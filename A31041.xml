            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>IF you have converſed with the Former Volumn of this eminently holy Man's Papers, we reckon, we need do no more to envite you to a ſerious delightful Peruſal of this Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, then to aſſure You, that they are more of Mr. <hi>Joſeph Barrett's</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and indeed we ſcarce need to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify that neither, themſelves do teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy it, they have the ſame Rich Vein of more then ordinary Judiciouſneſs, Savouringneſs and Spirituality run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning through and ſparkling in them as did in the Former, the ſame marks of eminent Impreſſes and large Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies of God's Spirit, and the ſame ſigns of a Man very much in Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God, and inflamed with Love to and Zeal for God, of one
<pb facs="tcp:45231:3"/>much in Heaven during the little time he was here on Earth, his True, and ſomewhat peculiar Character.</p>
            <p>Which makes it not ſtrange at all that he was ſo ſoon removed to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the place his Heart was ſo much in, and he drove ſuch a great Trade with, and that he was ſo ſoon remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from Earth a place ſo grievous to him, by reaſon of its-aboundings Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and withheld and which vexed his Righteous Soul from day to day, in ſeeing and hearing its ungodly Deeds; nothing revived him more than the Succeſs of his Projects for Chriſt and Souls.</p>
            <p>And in imitation of his Bleſſed Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter (whom we never find weeping for any of his own, though peculiarly hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Affliction and ſore Sufferings, but only for either the Sins or Calamities of others) nothing grieved him more than to ſee the hardneſs of Men's Hearts, their oppoſition to the Bleſſed Jeſus, and the ſad proſpect this gave
<pb facs="tcp:45231:3"/>of Judgment upon Them and the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If an ill Spirit broke out with any Prevalence, and the Intereſt of Religion ſeemed to give ground; if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Adventure of Prayer, many of which he made, and put others upon making, and bleſſed be God with good Succeſs; but if at any time, any ſuch Adventure did not make the return he hoped for, how near did it go to his Heart, out of his Apprehenſion of God's Diſpleaſure, and fear of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Duty of Prayer come into Diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit: This grived him much more than the failure of any the greateſt Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers in the Buſineſs of his ſecular Calling. Appreheſions of God's being provoked and diſpleaſed, and fears of the Conſequences of it, ſat heavy, made deep Impreſſions upon the Spirit of this <hi>Joſiah,</hi> whoſe Heart through Grace was peculialy ſoft and tender; the Zeal of God's houſe did eat him up.</p>
            <p>Several things of his, and (upon many Accounts we have reaſon to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude)
<pb facs="tcp:45231:4"/>valuable ones, are locked up from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing publickly uſeful, by being written in Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters: But bleſſed be God that ſo ordered it, that ſo much of the good Treaſure of this Scribe inſtructed to the Kingdom of Heaven, this well furniſhed Houſholder is left unlocked, and ſtands open for publick <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe. The things this Second Volumn conſiſts of, we ſhall not ſtay you in giving you our Judgments particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly of them; but leave you to make a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them your Selves, when you have peruſed them. Only it may not be amiſs to give ſome brief Account of the nature and method of thoſe Conferences, that one of theſe Tracts hath relation to. The Reader there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is deſired to take Notice. That in the Congregation (of which this Holy Man was a Member,) there is a meeting of ſeveral Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians once a Week from Five to Seven of the Clock at Night, for mutual Edification, which is ſpent only in Prayer, repeating of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and ſinging of Pſams, on thoſe Nights when the Miniſters are not preſent. But uſually once in a Month the Miniſters are there, and then ſome practical Queſtion or Caſe of Conſcience is propounded and diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of, and every Man preſent hath liberty to propound his own Thoughts, and ſpeak his own Experience. Prayer begin and together with a Pſalm or Spiritual Hymn, cloſes the Exerciſe: The Miniſter opens the Queſtion,
<pb facs="tcp:45231:4"/>and in the Cloſe ſums up the ſubſtance of what hath been diſcourſed of. Theſe meetings this good Man was a great Lover and Promoter of, yet ſuch was his great Modeſty, that be ſeldom ſpoke himſelf, but wrote his Thought and put them into a Friends hands (with a charge of privacy as to the Author) who read them towards the cloſe of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe: Having thus acquainted you with what we think neceſſary, in relation to theſe Papers, we recommend them to your ſerious powerful Peruſal, you and them to the Bleſſing of the God of all Grace, and our Selves to your Prayers, who deſire help through your Prayers, and the ſupply of the Spirit, he obtain help to be</p>

                     <hi>QUESTION I.</hi> How may a man know that he is led, or acted by the Spirit of God?</head>
                  <p>BEfore I anſwer directly, I beg leave to lay down a few things, which I think may tend a little to clear the queſtion, and to prevent Miſtakes about it; As,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That there muſt be a principial of Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Life infuſed into the Soul in the Work of Regeneration, before a Man can be ſaid to be lead by the Spirit. By Nature we are all Men and Women of another Spirit, lead and acted by that contrary Spirit <hi>which works in the Children of Diſobedience,</hi> Eph. 2.2. Rom. 8.14. <hi>For as many as are lead by the Spirit of God, they are the Sons of God,</hi> Gal. 5.25. <hi>If we live in the Spirit, let us alſo walk in the Spirit;</hi> There muſt be Spiritual Life before there can be any Spiritual Motion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That they Regenerate themſelves tho' they are renewed in every part, yet they are renewed but in part; They have in them while they are in this Life, Fleſh as well as Spirit; and while we have Sin in us, it will be acting its Part, the fleſh will be luſting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Spirit; Rom. 7.21. <hi>I find then a Law that when I would do good, evil is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with me,</hi> Gal. 5.17. <hi>For the Fleſh luſteth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Spirit, and the Spirit againſt the ſteſh;</hi>
                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:45231:6"/>and theſe are contrary the one unto the other, ſo that ye cannot do the things that ye would.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That as men eaſily may, ſo they are very prone to miſtake in this Point.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Bad Men; <hi>Saul</hi> when in his perſecuting Courſe, before his Converſion, he verily thought that he was in the way of his duty, and ſo fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the Motions of Gods Spirit, <hi>Act.</hi> 26.9. But we ſee how his Mind was changed after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; that which before he took for Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Zeal, a Fruit of the Spirit, he then ſaw to be no better than exceeding madneſs.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Good Men; when they ſeriouſly conſider what depends upon this Point; <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9. <hi>Now if any Man hath not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of his,</hi> v. 13. <hi>For if ye live after the Fleſh, ye ſhall dye:</hi> And when they think of the deceitfulneſs of their own hearts, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.9. <hi>The heart is deceitful above all things, and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately wicked, who can know it.</hi> And when they further conſider how prevalent the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining fleſhly intereſt is in their hearts and lives, this makes many a gracious Soul tremble when it comes to decide the Point, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to bring in a falſe Judgment againſt it ſelf, unleſs that bleſſed Spirit ſhine upon it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That miſtakes here are very dangerous and miſchievous; That Man who thinks he hath, and is lead by the Spirit, and is not, woe to him, for he is a loſt Man, if he find not out his miſtake before Death and Judgment unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him.</p>
                  <p>And then a miſtake on the other hand, will cauſe the poor Soul to drive on but heavily and uncomfortably in the way of its duty, tho' its Eſtate in the main may be ſafe? Have none of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:45231:6"/>us cauſe to know the Heart of ſuch in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? Now to the Caſe propounded I would an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer in general thus.</p>
                  <p>I think that Man, and he alone is lead by the Spirit, the habitual and prevailing bent of whoſe Heart, the main Scope and drift of whoſe Life is Spiritual. As for particular marks, I ſhall content my ſelf with a very few, which I take to be ſafe and ſcriptural; ſo,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Such as are lead by the Spirit of God, they are by him free from the ruling Power of the Fleſh, Rom. 8.1, 2. <hi>There is therefore now no Condemnation to them who are in Chriſt Jeſus, who walk not after the Fleſh, but after the Spirit; For the Law of the Spirit of Life in Chriſt Jeſus, hath made me free from the Law of Sin and Death.</hi> Gal. 5.16. This I ſay then, <hi>walk in the Spirit, and ye ſhall not fulfil the Luſts of the Fleſh;</hi> Walking after the Spirit, and walking after the Fleſh are directly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in Scripture: ſuch, they ſin ſtill; alas, that is a ſad truth which cannot be denied, for there is not a juſt man upon earth that doth good and ſinneth not, <hi>Ecl.</hi> 7.20. yet he that is born of God, he doth not, he cannot commit Sin; <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.3, 9. He lives not in the ruling Love and practice of Sin; He can in ſome Meaſure ſay what the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> [<hi>For that which I do I allow not, for that which I would that do I not, but what I hate that do I,</hi> Rom. 7.15.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They are ſuch as have ſolemnly taken the holy Spirit for their Guide, and given up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to his Conduct; <hi>They were baptized in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Name,</hi> Mat. 28.19. And every time they do renew the Covenant, they do ſincerely and afreſh renew their Obligations to obey and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45231:7"/>him. Before Converſion they rejected him, his Counſels and Ways, and were only for fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the Inclinations of their own evil Hearts, and the Courſe of this World: But now they have made a better choice; They deſire he would teach, lead and guide them; ſuch Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions are very frequent; And they have an Ear to hear, and an Heart to follow him; Joh. 10.3, 4.—<hi>And the Sheep hear his Voice, and he calleth his own Sheep by Name, and he leadeth them out; and when he putteth forth his own Sheep, he goeth before them, and the Sheep follow him, for they know his Voice;</hi> By the Spirit it is that great Shep-heard teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his Sheep to know his Voice, by him he calleth them both to, and after him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They are ſuch as have choſen the Word of God for their Rule; In the Word it is that the Spirit Speaketh to the Churches, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.7. In the Word he hath chalked out the Paths of Holineſs, wherein he leadeth ſuch as he hath made willing to follow him.</p>
                  <p>And they pray with <hi>David,</hi> [<hi>Lord teach me thy Statutes,</hi> Pſal. 119.12. <hi>Let me not wander from thy Commandments;</hi> Indeed the Fleſh will be reſiſting and rebelling, endeavouring to ſtop them in, or to turn them out of the way, which will cauſe them to take many a falſe Step; But yet, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.22. <hi>They delight in the Law of God after the inward Man:</hi> In the bent of their renewed Mind and will they delight in it, and deſire to obey it perfectly, and allow not themſelves in the breach of any part thereof.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Such as are lead by the Spirit, their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is free and voluntary, not by force and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:45231:7"/>conſtraint; They are lead, not haled or dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; Joh. 10.3, 4. <hi>He calleth them by Name, and leads them out, and goeth before them, and they follow him;</hi> They are a willing People, Pſal. 110.3. 1 Cor. 4. <hi>Draw me, and we will run after thee;</hi> Indeed a Partical. Unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs will be found in the beſt while here; while we have Fleſh in us, it will be drawing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother way; But yet, Holineſs is this Mans choice; And when he is in a holy Frame and Courſe, he is as in his Element: The habitual prevailing bent of his Heart is for a Courſe of Holineſs, and this appears in the main Scope and drift of his Life; and this I think doth denominate us what we are, and that therefore by it we may ſafely judge of our ſelves.</p>

                     <hi>QUESTION II.</hi> How may we come to find out and know what are our ſpecial ſins, and what means are to be uſed for the Mortification of them?</head>
                  <p>The queſtion before us Conſiſts of two Parts.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. How may we come to find out and know what are our ſpecial Sins?</item>
                     <item>2. What means are to be uſed for the Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of them?</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>As to the former of theſe, I ſhall give you my poor thoughts thus.</p>
                  <p>Tho' we have in our Hearts by Nature that which is the Seed and Principle of all Sin, and tho' the unregenerate are under the Power and the Dominion of every Luſt, yet they, yea and the godly themſelves, who ſincerely deſire and endeavour to diſown and renounce all Sin, yet even they as well as the former have ſome one
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:45231:8"/>ſin or more which may in a peculiar manner be called their iniquity, their ſpecial ſin; And in order to the diſcovery what this ſin, or ſins are, I think,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Our work lieth with God; and,</p>
                  <p n="2">2 With our own Hearts and Conſciences; and ſo, 1. We muſt be very ſincere and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate with God in Prayer, that he would pleaſe to diſcover and make them known unto us; <hi>The heart is deep, the Deceitfulneſs and Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it exceeding great, who can know it? Jer.</hi> 17.9. We are naturally prone more eaſily to ſpy out Faults in others then in our ſelves, and the great Traitor (our ſpecial ſin) lieth cloſeſt of all, and while the Devil and our Fleſh can hinder it, we ſhall not find him out: And therefore we have need to pray with <hi>Job,</hi> 13. <hi>chap.</hi> 23. <hi>Make me to know my Tranſgreſſion and my Sin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. When this is done, we muſt ſeriouſly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to bring our Hearts to the teſt, by ſome ſuch Queſtions as theſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. What Sins are they that we are moſt ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enclined unto, and of all others moſt loath to leave or part with, our right Eye, and right Hand ſins, theſe are our ſpiritual Sins, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.29, 30. The young Man that came to our Lord, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. When he brought him to that trying Point about his Maſter Sin, which appears to be coveteouſneſs or worldlineſs, the news of parting with that makes him go away ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, he rather chooſing to take his leave of an only Saviour.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. What ſins are they that we are moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently and violently tempted to, the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions unto which we have leaſt Power to reſiſt,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:45231:8"/>and ſo conſequently are ofteſt foiled by? The Devil ſtudies this Point more (I am afraid) then many of us do, I mean it moſtly of my ſelf; and when he hath by diligent Obſervation found out which way our Inclinations carry us moſt ſtrongly, he ſuits his baits thereto; And if we obſerve, we ſhall find his ſtrongeſt batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and fierceſt Aſſaults to be on this our blind, our weakeſt ſide; and ſo we may obſerve, that in theſe Aſſaults we ordinarily come off worſt, many times halting, if ſometimes we get not broken bones; methinks this head is clear in it ſelf.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. What Sins are they which we find our Hearts moſt prone to think of, even when out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Objects are not before us, to prompt us to ſuch thoughts? What Sins are they that the thoughts that come moſt freely and immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from our Hearts are employed about? Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times theſe Sins will appear at the Mouth <hi>(For out of the abundance of the Heart the Mouth ſpeaketh,) Mat.</hi> 12.34. And as one of <hi>Jobs</hi> Friends, chargeth him. <hi>[Thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity.]</hi> But I think this is a more certain and conſtant Sign; <hi>[For as a man thinketh in his heart, even ſo is he.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. What Sins are they that we find our ſelves prone to entertain in our Thoughts, with great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Pleaſure and Delight?</p>
                  <p>What ſin is it that we are apt to conceive the greateſt Sweetneſs in? we may mark him out, or that's he; Tho' ſin is an evil and bitter thing in it ſelf, and in its Effects, and tho' it be ſo to the real apprehenſion of a Sincere Heart, yet in ſpite of it, the Fleſh will be contradicting it here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, eſpecially in relation to its great Maſter Luſt.</p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:45231:9"/>
                  <p n="5">5. What Sins are they that we are prone to make moſt Proviſion for, that we may fulfil the Deſires and Luſts thereof? Tho' others will be craving, and e're while crying feed me, and feed me, yet if we obſerve, we ſhall find we have the moſt frequent, impetuous, imperious calls from our Maſter Sins; The Fleſh will be from time to time prompting us moſt of all to plot and contrive and drudge for them; Theſe will crave and expect the largeſt allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, or <hi>Benjamins</hi> Meſs, and will be moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied and impudent in it.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. What Sins are they which Conſcience is want to give us the ſevereſt Checks for, when it is at at any time ſoundly awakened either by the Miniſtry of the Word, or under ſome ſmart Affliction; Conſcience will ſpeak and ſtrike home at ſuch a time, and then it is moſt likely to hit upon the right vein; <hi>Act.</hi> 2.37. <hi>Gen.</hi> 42.21. <hi>And they ſaid one to another, we are verily guilty concerning our Brother, in that we ſaw the anguiſh of his Soul, when he beſought us, and we would not here: therefore is this diſtreſs come upon us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now to the ſecond part of the queſtion, which indeed contains in it the harder part of our work.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Having found out what are our ſpecial Sins, what means are to be uſed for the Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Prayer is one Special means to be improv'd here; whatever ſpiritual work we take in hand, one great End of it lieth with God; And a Chriſtian will fight beſt upon his Knees; Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we may engage God and his ſufficient grace on our ſide, and ſo we may groundedly hope for
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:45231:9"/>Victory; we have the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi>'s courſe and ſucceſs here, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7, 8, 9.</p>
                  <p>But 1. We muſt ſee that in our Confeſſions here, we be particular, full, free and open hearted with God; we muſt open our wound if we would have cure; while we are for hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and concealing them nothing will be done, as it thereby appears we have no mind it ſhould.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We muſt ſee we lay the greateſt load of Sorrow upon them, and thereby endeavour to get them more imbittered to us.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We muſt ſee we be very ſincere and very fervent in our deſires after that Grace which alone can enable us to do the work; they will not regard the biggeſt, the hardeſt Words that we can give them, and they would but make a mock at ſuch ſtriplings as we are, if we take the Field without our Captain; if ever we give them any killing blow, it muſt be by God's ſtrengthning our Arm; and therefore we muſt not Pray as if we feared leaſt the Lord ſhould take us at our word, or leaſt he ſhould do it too ſoon, or like thoſe that are indifferent in the Matter, ſeeing if they die not by our hands, our life muſt go for their life.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We ſhould improve the Word of God here, which is the Sword of the Spirit, turning the Edge the Point of it againſt our ſpecial Sins; in ſome Senſe we may allude to the King of <hi>Syria</hi>'s Charge to his Officers, 1 King. 22.31. <hi>Fight neither with ſmall nor great, ſave only with theſe princely Luſts;</hi> I mean, that we make it our particular Care both in the reading and hearing of the Word, eſpecially to obſerve, lay up, and apply home to our ſelves thoſe Commands,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:45231:10"/>Reproofs, Promiſes and Threatnings which have a peculiar relation to our ſpecial Sins; could we but rightly manage this weapon, it would do great execution.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We ſhould dilligently improve our covenant Tranſactions with God this way. And 1. Our Baptiſm; in that Ordinance by the Hands of our Parents we took the Lord's liſting Money, whereby we were engaged to Fight againſt all his Enemies, but eſpecially againſt theſe his chief Competitors and grand Rebels: And this Act of our Parents for us, we have ſince ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly made our own, or at leaſt ought to have done it. 2. Such of us as have been made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of that precious Ordinance of the Lord's Supper, we both may and ought eſpecially to improve it this way; O the Blood of Chriſt, nothing like it for the killing of a Luſt; we may ſay of it as <hi>David</hi> of <hi>Goliah</hi>'s Sword, 1 Sam. 21.9. <hi>There is none like that, give it me;</hi> this is a proved tri'd weapon.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. When we do at any time afreſh renew our Covenant with God, either in that Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, or upon other Occaſions, we ſhould do it with a ſpecial Eye to theſe our ſpecial Sins. And that,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By labouring here eſpecially to lay hold on, plead and improve the Covenant on God's part; one main branch of the Covenant is, that he will ſubdue our iniquity, <hi>Mic.</hi> 7.19. Lord, let theſe epecially feel the Weight of thine Hand!</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By laying our ſelves under particular freſh and ſtrong Engagements againſt them; we ſhall find we need the moſt ſtrong and twiſted
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:45231:10"/>Cords, when we would bind theſe <hi>Sampſon</hi> Luſts.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We muſt fix and ſet our Reſolutions as againſt all Sin in General, ſo againſt theſe in ſpecial; as a good Souldier reſolves either to win the Field, or lay his Bones there, ſo we ſhould be at a Point with them; but while we are wavering and halting between two Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, there is no hope we ſhould make any work of it.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We muſt be careful we make no proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for them, and ſo as much as poſſibly we can, avoid thoſe things which we have found to be occaſions of, or temptations to them; and by this means endeavour to ruine and ſtarve them out; we muſt with-draw, with-hold the Fuel, if we would have the Fire out.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Here we muſt be moſt ſtrict and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in our watch; here it is that our greateſt Danger lieth; here we are in moſt danger of being betrayed, here Satan is moſt likely to make his Breach: And if we be careleſs and ſecure here, we ſhall certainly be looſing ground; though we ſhould be no where ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, becauſe no where out of Danger, yet we ſhould ſet the ſtrongeſt Guard and ſtricteſt Watch at the weakeſt Part of our Wall.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. We muſt labour to grow in all Grace, but above all in thoſe that are moſt directly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite unto our ſpecial Sins; we ſhould deſire and labour hard for ſome peculiar Eminency in thoſe Graces, and could we but attain this, it would prove an excellent Means; for this is certain, as Grace gets up, Sin muſt down; as in Nature, contraries will expel each other, ſo it is here, the more we grow in humility,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:45231:11"/>the more that Pride will be laid in the duſt; the ſame we may ſay of any other Sin: Can none of us ſet to our <hi>Probatum eſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. If ordinary Means fail, we muſt then betake our ſelves to extraordinary, I mean to ſolemn Faſting and Prayer; as our Lord ſaid of that Devil the Diſciples could not Caſt-out, <hi>Math.</hi> 17.21. <hi>This kind goeth not out but by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting and prayer,</hi> ſo (as ſome of our beloved Miniſters have obſerved) there are ſome Luſts that will not otherwiſe be Caſt-out.</p>
                  <p>Now could we but thus do, and after all, humbly and believingly depend upon the free and ſoveraign Grace of God in Chriſt; we might verily hope that theſe <hi>Goliah</hi>'s (how much ſoever they may have defied us hitherto) ſhould not be able to ſtand before us.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. What Conſiderations ſhould move us to endeavour the Mortification of them? <hi>Anſw.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Lord doth indiſpenſibly require it, Col. 3.5. <hi>Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth</hi>—. This with other the like Scripture precepts are eſpecially applicable here; not a limb of the old Man, that by the Lord's leave ſhould be ſpared, but eſpecially we ſhould lay at his Heart, at thoſe Parts and Members of him where his life and ſtrength mainly lieth [put away (ſaith <hi>Samuel</hi>) the ſtrange God's and <hi>Aſtaroth</hi>]; it is probable that was one of their chief and moſt provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Idols, and therefore named in particular. And I think one may ſafely ſay, That Man who doth not ſincerely deſire and endeavour in Obedience to ſuch Commands, the Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of his ſpecial Sins, the putting away of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:45231:11"/>his <hi>Aſtaroth,</hi> he doth not, nor can he be ſaid ſincerely to obey them as to any of the reſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Though a ſingle Command from God, be enough to make this or any other thing our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſible Duty, yet here we are under other as ſtrong Ties and Obligations as can be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined; we are the Lord's by manifold Right; how many things he hath to ground a moſt juſt and unqueſtionable claim to us and our ſervice upon? And farther, we are his by our own (and I hope many of us may ſay ſincere and hearty) Conſent; we have ſworn unto the Lord, and may not go back; now it is a thing in it ſelf impoſſible that we ſhould at the ſame time ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitually and prevailingly love and ſerve God and Sin too; no Man can Serve two Maſter's ſo contrary; and therefore we muſt endeavour the Mortification of them, as we would not be guilty of the moſt horrid Perfidiouſneſs, as well as Diſloyalty and Rebellion, by ſiding with theſe Tyrannical Uſurpers (which as ſuch we have at leaſt in pretence renounced) againſt him that is our moſt rightful, gracious and ſolemnly avowed Soveraign Lord.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Without this we can have no clear ſound and comfortable Evidence of the ſincerity and integrity of our Hearts; this ſeems clearly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.23. <hi>I was alſo upright before him, and I kept my ſelf from mine iniquity;</hi> and it is a thing very clear in it ſelf, for that Oppoſition againſt Sin which is right, it is and muſt be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Sin as it is Sin, that is, as it is ſo direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contrary to the moſt holy Nature, Will and Law of God, and ſo directly oppoſite to his Glory; and ſo conſequently it muſt be againſt
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:45231:12"/>all Sin, and eſpecially againſt our ſpecial Sins: and therefore we muſt endeavour the Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of theſe, or in vain we hope for any well grounded Peace or comfortable aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Theſe are the main Obſtructers of our growth and progreſs in Grace and Holineſs; theſe are the Chief of thoſe ſuckers and luxurious Branches we have been told of ſo frequently of late; as a prevailing ill Humour in our Bodies, ſo are theſe in our Souls; whatever elſe we do in Religion, all will prove but to little purpoſe, we muſt never think to be any body for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, while we ſuffer theſe to Lord it over us: The Devil knows this well enough, and ſo he will give us leave to do almoſt any thing elſe, while we will but keep far enough from theſe, but touch theſe; and we touch the Apple of his Eye, he cannot endure it, knowing that if we do it in good earneſt, his Intereſt in us is then like to go down apace; as ever we deſire to be thriving Chriſtians, we muſt endeavour to get rid of theſe.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Theſe Sins of ours ſlew our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and then ſurely if we let theſe go, if we let theſe live, we are not Jeſus his Friends; this ſhould be a very moving Conſideration to us; the pardon of any one of our Sins could not have been obtained, but at the expence of that precious Blood of his; and if we may ſuppoſe that ſome of our Sins gave him our deareſt Lord a deeper Wound, a Sore or Bruiſe, then others of them, they were theſe; and do they not deſerve a Wound from us? Should we not endeavour to give them a deadly cruſh for this? Yea it was one ſpecial End of his
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:45231:12"/>Death to deſtroy theſe: And ſhall he die for us, and (as to us) looſe his labour when he hath done?</p>
                  <p n="6">6. We ſhould be quicken'd to our Work here, eſpecially at ſuch a time as this is, for <hi>England</hi>'s ſake, and for the Ark of God amongſt us; Matters ſeem to be at a very tickle tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Point; what the Lord intends to do we know not, but really many things looks very threatning, and God's faithful Miniſters, who are like to know moſt of his Mind, are often droping ſuch hints as would make a ſenſible Heart tremble: Now this is the beſt way that we can take to prevent <hi>England</hi>'s Ruine, nay if God ſave us not by his Prerogative Royal it is the only way; and it is unqueſtionably the duty of each of us to be fighting for our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try at home, and thus we may do it; and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> hath not a worſe Enemy then Sin, nor better Friends at this pinch then ſuch as do heartily and vigorouſly ply their work here; and now ſhall <hi>England</hi>'s Ruine ly at our doors; Or ſhall deliverance come, and we do nothing to ſet it forward on its way?</p>
                  <p n="7">7. This work though it be hard and difficult, yet it is not impoſſible, nay if we do ſincerely apply our ſelves to it in God's way and ſtrength, the Victory is certain; it is very true, our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies are many and mighty, but its alſo as true, that they are all ſuch as have been baffled and conquered; it muſt be confeſſed that we are poor weak things: But withal, it muſt be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that our Captain is ſtrong; we may ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to ſet one Lord Jeſus againſt them all; this is a mighty encouragement to our work, but no argument for ſloth, for he requires we
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:45231:13"/>ſhould be active in it, though in a manner he doth the work to our hands; He hath over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come all the Enemies of our Souls, and hath purchaſed that Grace for us whereby we alſo ſhall be enabled to overcome; and how many Saints are there now triumphing in Heaven with <hi>Palms</hi> in their Hands, who were once as deeply engaged in the Conflict, and it may be under as diſcouraging Circumſtances as we can be; we have the ſame Captain that they had, and what he hath done in and for them he is ready to do, yea and will certainly and ſhortly do for and in us if we belong to him, abide in him, and continue with him; ſo that difficulties ſhould not be pleaded by us as diſcouragements in a Matter of this nature and neceſſity.

And <hi>laſtly,</hi> There is no other way for us here, but we muſt either kill or die; Sin (as ſome of us lately heard) is ſuch a tyrant, all whoſe Laws are written in the Blood of Souls: It is Sin that brought Death into this World, and that hath digged Hell in the next; nothing ſo deadly as Sin; and ſuppoſe but one Sin al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed and ſpared, that one would as infalla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly undo us for ever as a thouſand: And far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſuppoſe our Hearts be ſincere and ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailingly for God and therefore ſafe in the main, yet if we neglect our Duty, here thoſe Sins of ours will not only keep us ſhort, both as to Grace and Peace here (as was hinted before), but (which is a neceſſary conſequent) they will alſo cauſe us to fall ſhort of thoſe Degrees of glory, which otherwiſe we might hereafter have attained unto, the leaſt degree of which ſhould be of more account with us, then all our worldly Intereſts laid together, yea then all this

                     <hi>QUESTION III.</hi> How is the Duty of giving and receiving reproof to be managed?</head>
                  <p>THAT it is the Duty not only of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to reprove Sin in others, though to do it Miniſterially is peculiar to them by Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of their Office and their Commiſſion and Charge thereupon: But yet that it is alſo the Duty of private Chriſtians is plain, Lev. 19.17. <hi>Thou ſhalt not hate thy brother in thy heart; thou ſhalt in any wiſe rebuke thy neighbour, and not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Sin upon him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now in anſwer to the <hi>Queſtion,</hi> how this Duty is to be managed, I ſhall give my thoughts:
<list>
                        <item>1. By laying down ſome things which I take to be neceſſary Qualifications, in the Perſon that would be a right ſucceſsful Reprover.</item>
                        <item>2. Some needful Cautions.</item>
                        <item>3. Some general Rules and Directions.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Qualifications are as follows:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Wiſdom and Prudence; theſe are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, becauſe the right management of this Duty is a work of no ſmall difficulty; and for want of theſe ſome well meaning Perſons marr the Work, and inſtead of doing good do harm this way; light and heat ſhould go together, otherwiſe the Motion will be irregular; we need theſe to direct us in ſuiting our Reproofs.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To the Perſons we Reprove. And that,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. With reſpect to their different Eſtates: For, though we muſt be Faithful to all, yet we
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:45231:14"/>may not uſe the like freedom of Expreſſion with all, Job. 34.18. <hi>Is it fit to ſay to a King, thou art wicked? Or to Princes, ye are ungodly?</hi> 1 Tim. 5.1. <hi>Rebuke not an Elder, but entreat him as a Father.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. With reſpect to their Diſpoſition and Temper: For, ſome are naturally more ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born and hard to work on, others more ſoft and tender, Jude, 22, 23. <hi>And of ſome have compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, making a difference: And others ſave with fear, pulling them out of the fire;</hi> I know it, there are ſome of that temper, and eſpecially where any of them are alſo under that diſtemper, which renders them more capable of impreſſions of this ſort; take ſuch ordinarily I ſay, and one ſhall wound them deeper with the ſofteſt Word, nay with a ſilent Reproof in a look, then ſome others with the moſt ſharp and cutting Reproof.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We need theſe to direct us to ſuit our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof to the Nature of the Offence, according as it is either more open or ſecret, or as it is greater or ſmaller, either in its ſelf, or in its circumſtances, or in its probable conſequents.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. As to the Time: The Preacher ſaith, <hi>To every thing there is a ſeaſon, and a time to every purpoſe under Heaven,</hi> Ecl. 3.1. And ſo <hi>a time to keep ſilence, and a time to ſpeak,</hi> v. 7. <hi>And a wiſe man</hi>'s <hi>heart diſcerneth both time and judgment,</hi> Chap. 8.5. Very much lieth in the right time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Reproof; ſuch a Word ſpoken in Seaſon, how good is it? I know indeed in ſome Caſes, the Matter may not admit of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay; and likewiſe that delays ſometimes may endanger a neglect: But yet methinks where it may, we ſhould take the fitteſt time, which in General I think is, 1. When we find our
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:45231:14"/>own Spirits in a temper in ſome meaſure fit to give the Reproof; if I find boiſtrous unruly Paſſions up, that is no fit time for me to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove another in. 2. When the Perſon to be reproved is fitteſt to receive it, and like to get moſt good by it; we may learn this from <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall</hi>'s prudent Carriage of the matter, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.36, 37. ſhe would not Reprove <hi>Nabal</hi> till the Wine was gone out of him; ſo to reprove a Man in the heat of his Paſſion, it is like to do no good, but farther to enrage him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Humility and Meekneſs, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.24, 25. I know this and ſome other Scriptures produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, were ſpoken directly to Miniſters, yet in a Proportion they ſhew every one of us our Duty too; and what Sin is there that we Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove in others, that in ſome reſpect, degree or other, we have not been guilty of our ſelves? However we need not look for into our Hearts to find the ſeed and root of it, and of all other Sins whatever; yea more, no thanks to the beſt of us, that we are not as bad as the vileſt Wretch that breaths; and ſure here is enough if duly conſidered, to humble and meeken our Spirits, when we have to do with others in the way of Reproof: And as this is fitting upon our own Account, ſo likewiſe needful upon the Account of the Party reproved, becauſe ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily he will but too hardly be perſwaded, but that we are Proud and take too much upon us, or that we bear him ill Will, and are for pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a quarrel with him; one may believe that Man hath more Grace than ordinary, that can take a Reproof well, which is given him in a ruff, proud, and lofty Manner.</p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:45231:15"/>
                  <p n="3">3. Love, Pity and Compaſſion; that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Rule, 1 Cor. 16.14. (<hi>Let all your things be done with charity</hi> (or love), reacheth this Caſe; indeed we muſt hate the Sin we reprove in another, and we may and ought to expreſs our hatred of it: But we may not hate his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, nay we muſt ſee we love him; yea, though he be a wicked Man, yet we muſt love him as a Man, and ſo capable of Grace, and much more if he be one already made partaker of it; and we muſt endeavour by loving Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions to wind in our Reproof as advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly as may be; and ſo alſo we muſt do it with much Pity and Compaſſion to his weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and infirmity, conſidering our ſelves that we alſo are in the Body, and have in us the like body of Sin, and ſo are not yet out of the Tempters reach, or out of Danger by his Temptations.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Zeal and Courage; as God's Glory is ſtruck at, and in ſome ſenſe wounded and ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhed by every Sin committed by our ſelves or others (though to ſpeak ſtrictly and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God is impaſſible, quite out of the reach of Sin and Sinners, our wickedneſs may hurt a Man as we are, but not God, <hi>Job.</hi> 35.8. but no thanks to Sin or Sinners for that; he ſhould not be, might they but have their Will) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore lukewarmneſs and indifferency of Spirit here is a curſed thing; a holy heat become us well here, for which we have the higheſt Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern in the World, even him who in other things was the moſt meek and lowly in Heart; ſo when we are called to reprove thoſe that are above us (though I think it is not ſo ordinarily our Duty to reprove Superiors as others, they
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:45231:15"/>ſhould rather be dealt with by others, or by us in another way, yet where it is plainly our Duty) we ſhould not fear the Faces of any; ſo the Prophets of old, when they had God's Commiſſion and Charge, they ſpared not crowned Heads any more then others; and New Teſtament inſtances might alſo be eaſily produced here.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Intergrity and Faithfulneſs, and that both to God and Man; but I fear I enlarge too much, and alaſs, which is worſe but too impertinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Self-denial and Contempt of the World; this is a neceſſary Qualification, becauſe if we will be Faithful to God and Souls, it may ſo fall out, that we may be called to reprove ſuch as to outward things we may have moſt depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on, whoſe Favour of all others we are moſt loath to looſe, which may be hazarded by a faithful Reproof; this the Fleſh knows how to improve; but here carnal Sinful-ſelf muſt be denied, the World contemned when it ſtands in the way of our Duty; and if we would but be Faithful to God, we ſhould find him ſo to us: Forthwith an upright Man, he will ſhew himſelf upright.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Cautions are theſe:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That we reprove not that as Sin, which indeed is not ſo; we muſt take heed of that; for it would be Sin in us, and ſo juſtly deſerve a Reproof from them; this was in ſome degree that good Man's Fault, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.14, 15. And ſo <hi>Peter</hi>'s Fault, <hi>Math.</hi> 16.22. For which our Lord gave him as ſevere a Rebuke as moſt we meet with, <hi>v.</hi> 23.</p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:45231:16"/>
                  <p n="2">2. That we reprove not other's for that Sin which we have not good ground to charge them with, and are not able ſome way to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them of, though I think in this Caſe it may be a Duty to give ſome friendly Intimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of what we either ſuſpect or hear, in a way as inoffenſive as may be, and I dare ſay, this is far more Chriſtian like, then haſty, raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judging upon weak grounds, and its ten to one on ſuch as are falſe; by which, how much ſome have ſuffered the Lord knows; which it is a dangerous thing I think, to give a downright Reproof upon meer ſurmiſe, or upon bare here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay, eſpecially in this cenſorious detracting Age, when falſe Reports are ſo common in Men's mouth's, yea too often in the mouth's of thoſe that are Wiſe and Good, though alaſs this is no part either of their wiſdom or good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We ſhould beware we do not throw away our Reproofs upon ſuch as are unworthy of them, ſuch as would but abuſe them, and us for them; I think this Caution is warranted by, and may be grounded upon ſuch Scriptures as theſe, Math. 7.6. <hi>Give not that which is holy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to dogs,</hi> &amp;c. Prov. 9.8. <hi>Reprove not a ſcorner, leaſt he hate thee;</hi> though we muſt uſe this with Caution, and not falſly call and account others ſo, and then think our ſelves excuſed from our Duty.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The general Rules are as follow:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In the buſineſs of Reproof, we muſt not only have regard to the Matter and Manner of it, but we muſt likewiſe take notice what are our principle Motives and Ends, and ſee that they be right; in general it is the Glory of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:45231:16"/>God, the Good of others with our ſelves that we ſhould aim at, a deſire of promoting which ſhould ſet us on work, influence and guide us in the whole of it; ſhould we reprove others from a proud, envious, unquiet or malicious Spirit, merely with an intent to provoke, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace them, or the like, this were to ſay the Commandment backward, which would be ſad work; we muſt be very dilligent, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and careful to get rid of, or avoid as much as poſſibly we can, thoſe things in our ſelves which we reprove in others; want of due Care here, we ſhall find exceedingly to damp our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and to be a very great obſtruction to the diſcharge of our Duty; ſo it will alſo cauſe us and our Reproofs to be leſs regarded, if not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed by others, they will not have that autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in them, but they will be ready in Heart at leaſt, if not in words to retort that upon us [Phyſician Practice will be found another thing hereafter, then many I fear now take it for; but yet alſo heal thy ſelf.] Or that, <hi>Math.</hi> 7.3, 4, 5. We muſt not forget our ſelves ſo as to leave Prayer out, or rather ſo as to leave God out of the buſineſs for want of engaging him by Prayer; it is by Prayer that this word of Reproof muſt be ſanctified: When ever we are called to this Duty, we had need lift up a Prayer to God, that he would put ſuitable Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections into our Hearts, right Words which are forcible into our mouths, and that he would ſend the Arrow home to the Mark, and direct it to the White, and that he would ſo influence and wind about the Heart of the Party repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that our Reproof may not fail of attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our forementioned deſired end.</p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:45231:17"/>
                  <p n="4">4. If we would be profitable and ſucceſsful Reprover's our ſelves, we muſt then learn in like manner to receive a Reproof from others; but this brings us to the Second Part of the Caſe or Queſtion, namely.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. How we are to manage a Reproof when it is given us by others?</p>

                     <hi>QUESTION IV.</hi> What muſt the People of God do when he is teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying againſt them?</head>
                  <p>AS the Carriage of God's People towards him, ſo his Diſpenſations towards them are very various; ſometimes he ſmiles and lifts them up; ſometimes he frowns and caſts them down; a right and ready compliance with God in all his providential Diſpenſations towards us, is our plain and indiſcenſible Duty, and that wherein much of the Excellency of a Chriſtian lieth: Now in anſwer to this ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Queſtion (which I take as chiefly aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the Publick, God's teſtifying againſt us in his Judgments there, though withal, it with the anſwers to it, may be alſo applied unto a private Caſe) take my poor Thoughts in the following Particulars:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We muſt ſee and take notice of God's Hand, when it is either lifted up in his threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, or laid on in his Judgments; the great God expects (as well he may) to be heedfully noticed and obſerved by all, but more eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by his own People, as in what he ſaith, ſo alſo in what he doth, as in his Mercies, ſo in his Judgments; by the contrary we greatly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front and provoke him, as thereby we put a
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:45231:17"/>great and unworthy Slight upon him: This the Lord takes very ill, and by it we are like to bring more and greater Judgments upon our ſelves, Iſa. 26.11. <hi>Lord when thy hand is lifted up, they will not ſee, but they ſhall ſee;</hi> if we will not ſee his Hand, we are like to feel more of it till we cannot but ſee and take notice of it, Pſal. 28.5. <hi>Becauſe they regard not the work of the Lord, nor the operation of his hands, he ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them, and not build them up.</hi> This is One Part of our Duty.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. An holy awful fear and dread of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed God, and of his Judgments; the Name of the Lord is a <hi>glorious and fearful Name,</hi> Deut. 28.58. and as his Attributes ſo his Works alſo are part of his Name, and therefore grounds for our fear, and particularly his Works of Judgment: And ſo we read that <hi>Moſes</hi> was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid when God's diſpleaſure was hot againſt the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Deut. 9.19. And ſo 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.19. When <hi>Uzziah</hi> was ſmitten, it is ſaid, that <hi>David</hi> was afraid of the Lord that day; and elſewhere its he that ſaith, Pſal. 119 v. 120. <hi>My fleſh trembleth for fear of thee, I am afraid of thy judgments.</hi> It is the duty of all Men to fear him, who doth but look upon the Earth and it trembleth; who can and ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly will with one angry Frown, make all the ſtout hearted Sinners in the World fear him and tremble before him; but eſpecially he expects it from his own People who are better acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him, and know better then others do what the Smiles and Frowns of a God mean, and that eſpecially when he is meeting them in thoſe ways of his, in which he is terrible unto the Children of Men.</p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:45231:18"/>
                  <p n="3">3. We muſt juſtify God in his ſevereſt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations towards us; <hi>The Lord is righteous in all his Ways, and holy in all his Works;</hi> there are great depths ſometimes, but never any the leaſt <hi>irregularities</hi> or <hi>exceſſes,</hi> in any of his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; righteouſneſs is the Habitation of his Throne, even when Clouds and Darkneſs are round about him; as it is the Duty, ſo it hath been the Practice of God's People, when his hand hath lain heavieſt on them, yet to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe Righteouſneſs to him, and it becomes us to look on them and do likewiſe, to ſay as, Ez. 9.15. <hi>O Lord God of Iſrael thou art righteous,</hi> Neh. 9 33. <hi>Howbeit thou art juſt in all that is brought upon us, for thou haſt done right,</hi> Dan. 9.14. <hi>The Lord our God is righteous in all his works that he doth:</hi> Or as the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> in the Name of the Church, Lam. 3.22. <hi>It is of the Lord</hi>'s <hi>mercies that we are not conſumed, becauſe his Compaſſions fail not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. We muſt dilligently ſearch and try our Hearts and Ways; we are not now ſpeaking of a matter that is forreign to us; alaſs, it is our own Caſe; the Lord hath certainly a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy with us, if ever he had one with any People on this ſide utter Ruine; and his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy hath ſeemed to be very much, if not moſtly with his own People: Now methinks we ſhould each of us be ſaying, Lord, is it I? Without doubt it is Sin that hath broached this quarrel between God and us, and there is none of us without that <hi>Achan</hi> in our Tents, our buſineſs is to ſearch it out; this is one main Duty which both God's Word and his Rod points us too, Lam. 3.40. <hi>Let us ſearch and try our ways.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:45231:18"/>
                  <p n="5">5. Our next duty is a free and hearty Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of, a judging our ſelves for, and deep humiliation under the ſenſe of thoſe ſins we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, whereby we have provoked him; This the Lord ſtands upon, Lev. 26.40. <hi>If they ſhall Confeſs their iniquity, and the iniquity of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, with the Treſpaſs wherewith they have treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed againſt me, and that alſo they have walked contrary unto me;</hi> Jer. 3.13. <hi>Only acknowledge thine iniquity, that thou haſt tranſgreſſed againſt the Lord thy God;</hi> Hoſ. 5.15. <hi>I will go and return unto my place, until they acknowledge their Offence;</hi> This way we are to give Glory unto him, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 7.19. What large Confeſſions do we meet with in Scripture, made by the People of God, when his hand hath been upon them? When the Lord is teſtifying againſt us, and laying load up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us in his Judgments, we ſhould take his part, and this way be laying load upon our ſelves, tho' indeed in another ſenſe, this is the next way to eaſe our ſelves of the burden; <hi>I confeſſed, and thou forgaveſt, ſaith</hi> David; ſo, 2 Chron. 7.14. <hi>If my People ſhall humble themſelves;</hi> 1 Pet. 5.6. <hi>Humble your ſelves, under the mighty hand of God;</hi> When the Lord is laying us low by his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, our work is not to ſtruggle with him, but to fall at his Foot, to lay our Hearts low for our ſins.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Our Sins thus diſcovered and confeſſed muſt be forſaken, we muſt turn from them unto him that ſmites us; Without this the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer will neither pleaſe God nor any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail us; we muſt take things as God hath laid them together, If my People ſhall humble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and turn from their evil ways.</p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:45231:19"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Let us ſearch and try our ways and turn unto the Lord;</hi> This is the great Errand his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments come to us upon; Theſe things I think do not need ſo much to be proved, as to be urged and preſſed home upon our hearts; O that we could but effectually do that? It is ſin that hath bread the difference between God and us, by them we have been fighting againſt him, by them we have provoked this long ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God of ours unto his ſtrange work, and now that his terrible anger is thus kindled, there is but one way for us to take, that is to ſubmit, to lay down our Arms, unleſs we are reſolved to try it out with him; Nay, but let the Pot-ſheards ſtrive with the Potſheards of the Earth, but woe to us if thus we ſtrive with our Maker; who ever hardned himſelf againſt God and proſpered? We muſt therefore caſt away our Tranſgreſſions from us, and with indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſay to our ſins as <hi>Ephraim</hi> to his Idols, <hi>get ye hence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. We muſt ſeek unto God by Earneſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Prayer joyned with faſting; It is his will that we ſhould thus by Prayer enquire of him at all times, and for all things that we need, and that he hath promiſed; But eſpecially this is our Duty in ſuch times as theſe; <hi>Call upon me in the Day of Trouble;</hi> This the Lord expects, Hoſ. 5.15. <hi>In their Affliction they will ſeek me early;</hi> And ordinary Prayer muſt not ſerve the turn; The Lord looks for early earneſt Prayer; And ſo that we ſpend more time then ordinary in the Duty; Not that the Lord is wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the length of our Prayers, but the work that is to be done upon our own Hearts ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily requires it; And this joyned with faſting,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:45231:19"/>which God's plain and preſſing Commands, and the practice of his People thereupon in all Ages doth ſufficiently prove, particular inſtances of either of which I think are needleſs here.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. We muſt renew our Covenant with God, and by ſolemn vows bind our Hearts to their good behaviour for the future; we had need to take our Hearts at all the advantages we can, and at ſuch times we have them at an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; We too frequently and ſadly experience it how eaſily our Corruptions break through our ſtrongeſt Purpoſes and Reſolutions, they are but like <hi>Sampſons</hi> green withs to him. But now ſolemn Vows, and frequent renewing of our Covenants, provoided we be ſerious in it, theſe are obſerved to be good means to keep our treacherous Hearts from ſtarting back; Tho' here we muſt be careful we do not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnare Conſcience in matters of indifferency or impoſſibility; This hath been and ſtill is the practice of Gods People; <hi>Neh.</hi> 38. And becauſe of all this we make a ſure Covenant and write it, and our Princes, Levites and Prieſts ſeal unto it; which we have at large in the 10. Chapter.</p>
                  <p>And ſo we find <hi>David</hi> ſpeaking of the Vows that he had made in his diſtreſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66.13, 14.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. We muſt be careful to pay our Vows by a reſolved cleaving to the Lord, whatever comes upon us; Vows and Covenants ſolemnly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed lay us under further Obligations; Tho' its true, the Lord hath the higheſt Authority to command, and we are bound to obedience an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticedently to any ſuch acts of our own, by Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his moſt Supream and Abſolute right in us, and Sovereignty over us, reſulting therefrom; yet it is as true, that we cannot after ſuch ſolemn
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:45231:20"/>Tranſactions by ſin depart from God at ſo cheap a rate as before, no our guilt and his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure will thereby be the greater; and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in if the wiſe man's judgment may paſs, we act the part of egregious fools, Ecleſ. 5.4, 5. <hi>When thou haſt vowed a Vow unto God, defer not to pay, for the Lord hath no pleaſure in fools,</hi> pay that which thou haſt vowed; better it is that thou ſhouldeſt not vow, then that thou ſhould'ſt vow and not pay; Yea, we muſt thus cleave unto God, all his Judgments notwithſtanding; They indeed yield us a good reaſon why we ſhould leave ſin, but none why we ſhould leave him; but on the contrary, why we ſhould cleave more cloſely to him; Come on us what will, it ſhould be the care of our Souls, that we may be able to ſay with the Church, Pſal. 44.17.18, 19. <hi>All this is come upon us yet have we not forgotten thee; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have we dealt falſly in thy Covenant; our heart is not turned back, neither have our ſteps de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined from thy way; Tho' thou haſt ſore broken us in the place of Dragons, and covered us with the Shadow of Death.</hi>

We muſt hope and truſt in him and in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, even when his Providences ſeem in our ſhallow apprehenſions to run never ſo croſs to them; we muſt hold to it as an inviolable truth, in ſpite of all that ſenſe or Satan may object a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, that if the Mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken it, his hand ſhall make it good; It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded of <hi>Abraham, that againſt hope he believed in hope,</hi> Rom. 4.18. And we find <hi>David</hi> oft
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:45231:20"/>profeſſing his Reſolution to truſt in the Lord, whatſoever diſtreſs he was in; And ſo Job, Chap. 13.15. <hi>Tho' he kill me yet will I put my truſt in him;</hi> This is part of that glory which we may not give unto another, when in diſtreſs we thus betake our ſelves to creature Refuges, our Hearts depart from the Lord and ſet up ſuch creatures as Idols in his place, which thing the Lord hath curſed, <hi>but bleſſed are all they that put their truſt in him.</hi>

                  <p n="11">11.

We muſt take heed that we do it not by our Words; we muſt take heed we do not raſhly and uncharitably Cenſure them, take heed of ſuch Expreſſions, yea and of ſuch Thoughts too; our bad Hearts have by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture a wretched faculty this way; when Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons fall under Affliction, eſpecially if their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction be ſomewhat ſingular, either for kind or degree, we are ready preſently to conclude it muſt be for ſome extraordinary Guilt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Lord for wiſe and holy Ends beſt known to himſelf, many times culls out his deareſt and choiceſt Servants as to the honeſt Work, ſo to the ſoreſt Tryals, the greateſt Suſſerings; as a wiſe Commander or General will deal with his Souldiers; but this is the common Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; If an holy upright <hi>Job</hi> who was a non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuch in his Time, if he fall under an unuſual Calamity, wiſe and good Men will not down with it but he muſt needs be an Hypocrite; if a venomous Creature faſten upon a <hi>Paul</hi>'s Finger, the Barbarians will have it he is a Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer, or ſome ſuch like Offender, whom Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance ſuffers not to live; this is very ſinful, very dangerous and provoking; we have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for the Proof of this, Job, 42.7, 8. <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto</hi> Eliphaz, <hi>my wrath is kindled againſt thee, and againſt thy two Friends, for ye have not ſpoken of me the thing which is right as my ſervant</hi> Job <hi>hath,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Job</hi>'s three Friends feem to have been pious good Men, yet alaſs,

                  <p n="2">2. As we are able, and have opportunity, we ſhould be ready to adviſe, counſel and direct them how they ought to Bear, how they may improve their Afflictions, and alſo how they

                  <p n="4">4. If their Caſe be outwardly neceſſitous, we muſt actually Relieve them as we have Abillity and Opportunity; not only draw out our Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els to their Pity, but alſo our Purſes to their Relief; not only give them good Words, but alſo ſuch things as they need; thus we muſt endeavour to help them our ſelves.</p>

                     <hi>QUESTION VI.</hi> How may a Chriſtian come to bear the greateſt worldly Loſſes graciouſly?</head>
                  <p>BY a Chriſtian here we mean one that is ſo indeed; ſuch a one is not ſo ſecured by the Promiſe, or ſo hedged in by the Providence of God, but that outward Loſſes as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Afflictions may ſometimes break in upon him here, yea ſuch as are very Great, any but ſuch as would quite undo him as a Chriſtian: From theſe indeed he is as ſecure and ſafe as Eternal Truth can make him, and ſhall be ſo while that endures; but yet he may looſe his Staff, though he cannot looſe his God.</p>
                  <p>I think it may not be amiſs here to hint far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a word or two, what we mean by his bearing theſe Loſſes graciouſly.</p>
                  <p>And in general I think it is, to bear them by the ſpecial help of God's holy Spirit, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Rule of his Word, aiming therin chiefly and ultimately at his Glory.</p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:45231:24"/>
                  <p n="1">1. By the ſpecial help of God's holy Spirit; For, mere Nature when moſt highly refin'd and elevated, will not paſs with God for Grace, though ſometimes with Men it may; and all Grace flows from the Spirit, the immediate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirer, actor and perfecter of it in the Soul.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. According to the Rule of his Word; God's willing this or that ſhews ſufficiently that it is Good or Gracious, yea, it makes it to be ſo; and in his Word it is that he hath moſt fully and plainly told us what his Mind and Will is; and in reference to the Caſe before us, the Seripture abounds with that which may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect us in the ſtreight Line of our Duty, warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us we turn not aſide to the right Hand or to the left: But I may not add more here.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Aiming herein chiefly and ultimately at his Glory; For, though we may alſo look at our own Benefit and Advantage, yet not ſolely, ſeperately, or ſupreamly, but as in Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with and Subordination to the Glory of that God, of, through, and to whom are all things: But to do this (I ſhould rather have ſaid ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like it), merely to get a Name by ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be that which in Truth we are not, this is very mean and low, baſe hypocriſy, and that big with ſeveral other grievous Sins.</p>
                  <p>I thought theſe hints not altogether imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to the Caſe, though alaſs, its like the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count I have laid down is very lame and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>
                  <p>Now in <hi>Anſwer</hi> to the <hi>Queſtion,</hi> I ſhall lay down my thoughts under theſe three general Heads.</p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:45231:24"/>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. We muſt endeavour to rid, and then keep our Hearts as clear as we can of thoſe things which would hinder us.</item>
                     <item>2. We muſt ſeriouſly ply our Hearts with ſuitable moving Conſiderations.</item>
                     <item>3. We muſt diligently apply them to other ſeaſonable Chriſtian duties.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p n="1">1. We muſt endeavour to rid and then keep our Hearts as clear as we can of thoſe things which would hinder us, as they breed and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh a contrary frame in us.</p>
                  <p>To name ſome of the chief of them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Pride; an over high opinion of our ſelves, a fond conceit of ſome Worth or Defect in our ſelves; this is that which makes us ſo hard to be pleaſed when our condition is at beſt, and that which breeds and feeds in patience and diſcontent, when by Loſſes or other Afflictions our condition ſeems to be changing or changed for the worſe; ſo we muſt endeavour to get and keep Pride low.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Unbelief; when we cannot truſt God, take his word, lean upon a promiſe any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then we have ſenſible props to ſupport us; it is a very ſad and dreadful Truth, that tho' we will truſt any Man, even ſuch a one as we know to be an unrighteous diſhoneſt Man ſo far as we can ſee him, yet, we have much ado through unbelief to perſwade our wretched Hearts to truſt the moſt holy, righteous God, the God of Truth any farther; we muſt ſtrive with might and main againſt this evil Heart of unbelief.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Worldlineſs; when we have too high an opinion of worldly things, when we fancy them to be that which they are not, to have that in
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:45231:25"/>them which in truth they have not; and ſo when our affections go out inordinately to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, it is becauſe our affections to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards worldly things are ſo ſtrong, this is one great reaſon why the Want or Loſs of them is ſo ſtrong and heavy an Affliction to us, and why we are ſo weak and unable to bear it; was the World (inſtead of being in our hearts) placed under our foot as it ſhould be, our work would not be ſo difficult; we muſt labour hard that it may be ſo.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Miſtakes about the nature and end of ſuch Providences; we are very apt to miſconſtrue ſuch Providences, ready to think the Lord is about to undo us, when he is but taking ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yea, and that to the wiſeſt and beſt way to enrich us; ready to think he is about to kill us, when he is only letting us blood to ſave our life; the afflictions and conſolations of the Saints (as one ſaith) differ only in their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances; and as we heard not long ſince, there is a vaſt difference between ſuch Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences as they are diſpenſed to the wicked and to the godly; as to the former, the Rod is turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into a Serpent, but as to the latter, the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent is turned into a Rod: The Lord is ſtill cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly working about his own eternal purpoſe in the Salvation of our Souls, but we miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand him, and that is one great hinderance of our bearing ſuch diſpenſations as we ought.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. An over haſtineſs of Spirit in paſſing a judgment concerning ſuch Providences; this is one cauſe of our former miſunderſtanding of them; they are many times very dark and miſterious, and our firſt Apprehenſions about them are many times falſe and miſtaken ones;
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:45231:25"/>If we have obſerved God and our ſelves, we may remember that many Providences of which we have had but diſmal thoughts at firſt view, our thoughts have been mightily changed about them, when we have ſeen the beginning and end together, and ſo have read ſuch Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces backward; but alaſs we are ordinarily too quick with the Lord, will not give him time, have not patience till he hath brought the whole wheel about; and this is another thing that makes our work here ſo hard as it is, which therefore muſt be corrected and amended.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The Temptations of Satan; its like he will be ready to take this opportunity of bely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God to us, and after this or ſome ſuch manner to ſuggeſt; is this the God that loves thee? Is he now fulfilling his Promiſes and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering thy Prayers? See what a kind Maſter thou ſerveſt, and what thou getteſt by his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: Thus its like he will be prompting us to diſtruſt, impatience, diſcontent and the like; we muſt ſee we be not ignorant of his Devices, and as ſoon as we diſcover the Temptation, wich abhorrence we muſt reject it.</p>
                  <p>This to the firſt General.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We muſt ſeriouſly ply our hearts with ſuitable moving Conſiderations. And ſo,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We ſhould conſider that whatever we have loſt, and by what means and inſtruments ſo ever we loſt it, it is the Lord that hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it; there is certainly ſuch a thing as Divine Providence, permiting, ordering and bringing about whatever doth befal us here; when Loſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and other Afflictions befal us, the Lord takes it upon himſelf as his own doing, and God's People have been wont to ſee and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:45231:26"/>his hand, and this is that which hath ſtilled and calmed them, as we ſee in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded inſtance of <hi>Job, David</hi> and others.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We ſhould conſider, that whatever the Lord hath thus taken, he hath taken nothing but his own; <hi>The Earth is the Lord's, and the fulneſs thereof;</hi> we have nothing for enjoyment but what he gave us, and we are not properly Lord's of what we have but Steward's; God's right in his Creatures is ſuch, as cannot be alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated; we eat his Bread, wear his Wool and his Flax, carry his Silver in our purſes and the like; and now, why may not the Lord do what he will with his own?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We ſhould conſider, the Lord hath taken nothing from us, but what we were unworthy of when he gave it, and have ſince forfeited by our Sins, and but a part of that neither; the Lord is free when he gives, and juſt when he takes; we deſerve not the leaſt morſel of food, or a ragg to cover our nakedneſs with; and by our Sins we have forfeited all he hath thus free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given us a thouſand times over, yea, and our very beings too; and therefore we have great reaſon to be patient, yea, and thankful alſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all our loſſes here.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We ſhould conſider the things of this World, they are other things then the moſt of Men, yea, and then we our ſelves ordinarily take them to be; we think they look bravely at a diſtance, beholding them with a vitiated eye, and through a falſe deceitful medium; but if indeed we will come near and know the truth of the matter, we have it from him who never miſ-called either perſon or thing, that <hi>they are but vanity and vexation of Spirit,</hi> things that
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:45231:26"/>cannot profit, yea, things that are not: And is it not a vain thing for one extreamly to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet himſelf either about the gain or loſs of a little Vanity? Children and Fool's indeed will take on mightily for the loſs of a Toy, but Men of underſtanding know better.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Take theſe things at beſt, and yet there is danger of our having too much, as well as of our having too little of them, yea, I am apt to think more danger of the two; more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of our ſurfeiting through abundance, then of our pineing through want; and now the Lord knows better then we do what is enough, too little or too much for us, and we have great reaſon to conſide in his Wiſdom, Love and Care herein, and by our Carriage ſhould let him and others to ſee that we do ſo.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Be theſe things as good as they will, and do what we can, we cannot long enjoy them; Death at fartheſt will certainly part us and all our worldly Enjoyments at once, and that is upon its way, and coming as faſt as ever time that flying poſt can bring it, and hath certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken ſome ſteps towards us even ſince we nam'd it: Now this conſideration that the Time is ſhort, ſhould mightily moderate our affections towards theſe things both in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment, want or loſs of them.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. We ſhould conſider others of God's Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have met with, as great, yea far greater Loſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes then our's are, and have born them graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly; <hi>Job</hi> what a loſs had he, who of the richeſt Man in all the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> in one day became poor to a Proverb? <hi>David</hi> driven from a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and forced to fly for his Life; yet, we ſee how ſweetly they took it: Theſe and ſuch
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:45231:27"/>like examples ſhould both encourage and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en our endeavours here.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. We ſhould conſider how good it is that we thus bear them; hereby we ſhall pleaſe and honour God; hereby we ſhall credit Religion, letting the World ſee that whatever they faney, yet we find ſomething in it that is real, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that yields us real Support: Hereby we ſhall lay in for our own, both preſent and future ſweet Peace and Satisfaction.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. We ſhould conſider the Evil of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; as thereby we ſhall diſhonour God, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſy the Devil, diſcredit Religion, harden the World in their Miſtakes about it, break our preſent Peace, and lay in for our future Sorrow, which is the beſt that can come of it.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. We ſhould conſider if we are the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons concerned in this Caſe, Chriſtians indeed, then whatever we have loſt, yet, our all is ſafe; the Lord is his Peoples portion, their All; and ſo all that he is, all that he hath, its all theirs as they need it, and as it would be for their Good; thus it is, and thus it ſhall be in ſpite of Sin, Earth and Hell, <hi>for the mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken it, [I will be their God]</hi> and the Zeal of the Lord God of Hoſt's ſhall perform this, ſhall make it good: O methinks there is life and ſoul in this conſideration, if we know but how to draw it out!</p>
                  <p>Other things might be added, but I fear leaſt before this, I ſhould be thought tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We muſt diligently apply our ſelves to other ſeaſonable Chriſtian Duties.</p>
                  <p>So 1. We muſt give diligence to clear up our ſpecial Covenant Intereſt in God; I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:45231:27"/>reaſonably think to perſwade my Heart to bear ſuch Loſſes as it ſhould, unleſs I can ſhew it ſomething that I have, or at leaſt may have, which is as good or better then that which I have loſt; and to bare worldly Loſſes quietly becauſe I have much more of theſe things left, this is not right; and the bear having an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in God, will not be ſufficient for my Support, unleſs it be in ſome meaſure known to me; but if I know that this God whoſe Name is, I am, if I can make it out that he is my own God; I need not fear then at next word to ſay, all's my own, and then my Work here would be eaſy.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We muſt exerciſe our ſelves much in live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believing Meditations on him, and our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable Happineſs in him; there is certainly that in God which doth amply ſuit our caſe, and which would effectually do our work, but we muſt not expect this in the way of a Charm, or that God ſhould work Miracles for us; though I have the beſt Food upon my Table, yet, it will not nouriſh or ſtrengthen me unleſs I open my Mouth, take, chew and digeſt it; ſo it is here.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We muſt endeavour all we can to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain conſtant Communion with God; while a Soul enjoys real Communion with God, its well with that Soul, and much at one to it, whether it enjoys more or leſs of the Creature; a gracious Soul taſts that ſweetneſs in near and intimate Communion with God, that while this is enjoy'd, it takes little or no notice of what of the World it either hath or wants; O it finds Meat and Drink, Houſe and Lands, Friènds, Earth, yea and Heaven too in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:45231:28"/>with God! Hereupon there are ſuch ineffably ſwet Communications of God to the Soul, and ſuch mutual endearing Embraces, as immediately fill the Soul in each corner of it, with unſpeakable Satisfaction and Joy; but I muſt add, there is yet ſomething in it, which is an unutterable Secret; ſuch as experimental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know what it is for the Lord to deal fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly with them this way, ſuch will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what I mean; and would not this do our buſineſs now? What think you?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We muſt endeavour to keep up every Grace in good Heart, but eſpecially ſee we nouriſh and cheriſh the Grace of Faith, and keep that cloſe to its work; every Grace hath its proper work and office in the Soul, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all the reſt Faith is the great doer, and not the least among the bearers of Burthens; and in reference to this preſent Caſe, it will be well or ill with us, as our Faith is either lively or languiſhing.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We muſt be much in the ſearch and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the holy Scriptures; the Word of God abounds with precepts, promiſes, examples, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Applicable to our preſent Caſe; ſome little hath been hinted; I had thoughts here to have added more, but muſt forbear, being ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible I have over done. Once more,</p>
                  <p n="6">6. And <hi>laſtly,</hi> We muſt give our ſelves unto Prayer; when we have done our beſt, Satan will be ſolliciting Evil, and diſtempered Frames will be creeping on us; when its thus, we muſt run to God by earneſt and believing Prayer, there's no way like it; if ever we bear our Loſſes graciouſly, it muſt be by the ſpecial help of the Spirit, as hath been hinted, and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:45231:28"/>though the Lord ſometimes in the way of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, or of his ſoveraign Grace, is found of thoſe that ſeek him not, yet, the promiſe is made unto thoſe that ask.</p>

                  </list>
                  <p n="1">1. We muſt labour to diſcover, and then carefully to avoid thoſe Sins and Temptations which this Eſtate doth eſpecially expoſe us to. And,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Thoſe which do reſpect others. And ſo,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Thoſe which more directly reſpect God himſelf; ſuch as theſe, unmindfulneſs, forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of God, an alienation of our Hearts
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:45231:29"/>and Affections from him; a careleſs neglect of the Duties of his Worſhip, or a formal cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary dead and heartleſs Performance of them; O that in theſe things and the like, we did not ſpeak from ſo much ſad experience as we do! <hi>Again,</hi> Diſobedience and Rebellion; if <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheron</hi> be waxed fat, the next news we hear of him is that he kicked; we muſt beware of theſe things and the like.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Thoſe which do more directly reſpect our Brethren; and do we never in Proſperity meet with a Temptation, and find a Proneneſs in our Hearts, when we are as it were on the Top of the Hill to overlook, deſpiſe, contemn our poor Brethren that are below us in the Valley? <hi>Job</hi> ſaith <hi>[He that is ready to ſlip with his feet, is as a lamp deſpiſed of him that is at eaſe]</hi> if ſo, we muſt take heed of that: <hi>Again,</hi> Beware of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifulneſs towards them; have we a care they do not want our Bowels, but eſpecially that we do not hurt their's; take we heed that when we are at eaſe our ſelves, we be not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them who are not greived for the Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of others, but eſpecially that we add not to their Affliction; O beware we of any thing that looks like injury or oppreſſion; and as we muſt thus labour to diſcover and carefully to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void thoſe Sins and Temptations which reſpect to others. So,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Thoſe which do more directly reſpect our ſlves; and ſo take heed of Pride; this was the Devils Sin, and his Ruine, and he would have us like him in both; and do we not find our Spirits ready to be puffed up on this occaſion; I dare ſay, they are no ordinary Chriſtians with whom its otherwiſe: <hi>Again,</hi>
                     <pb n="49" facs="tcp:45231:29"/>Take we heed of Security; when our Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſeems to ſtand ſtrong, its well if our Hearts ſay not next, it ſhall never be moved; take heed of that: <hi>Again,</hi> Take we heed of Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality, an unlawful exceſſive waſtful Spending, or ſpending Waſtfulneſs of the Creature; I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member a choiſe Servant of God, one that hath laboured much amongſt us, once when I was with him in a fit of Sickneſs taking a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, he called for the Spoon back to lick it, ſaying, Jeſus Chriſt would have nothing loſt; in which (as I concluded), he had reference to his ordering the Fragments to be gathered up after that large and plentiful Feaſt upon a few Barly-loaves and two or three ſmall Fiſhes: <hi>Again,</hi> Take we heed of Senſuality; our Luſts will expect our Proſperity ſhould be a Feaſt for them; they will crave it, and the Devil will ſollicite for them, but theſe Beggers muſt be denied; we muſt take heed of ſenſuality and of worldineſs, take heed of ſinful inordinate pantings after, love to, uſe of, or delights in the Creature; This as to the firſt General.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We muſt labour to get acquainted with, and then conſcientiouſly and diligently to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge thoſe Duties, and exerciſe thoſe Graces which this Eſtate gives us a ſpecial call to, and advangage for. And,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Thoſe which more directly reſpect others. And ſo.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Thoſe which more immediately reſpect God himſelf; and ſo we muſt own and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge God as the free and gracious au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, founder, and maintainer of our Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and then it naturally follows hence, that we be thankful to him for it; and here a true
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:45231:30"/>Chriſtian hath far the Advantage of another Man, and is thereby laid under a ſtronger Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to this Duty, for he may ſee his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Proſperity, his outward Mercies coming from that ſelf ſame loving Hand and Heart that gave him his dear Chriſt; O how thankful ſhould a Chriſtian be! In a mercy that in it ſelf may be but ſmall, yet may he ſee and taſt that which is of more worth then a World; this is no phanatical Dream, but a proved and experienced Truth: <hi>Again,</hi> Doth it not alſo follow that we ſhould love him more dearly; Love would and ſhould be paid in its own Coin; and by the way obſerve it, if we can but find this, that we love God more for our outward Proſperity, this would be an infallible ſign that it comes from his Love, for as one ſaith, this is a certain Rule, that which cauſeth love, cometh from love; and then ſee that we grieve more ingenuouſly for our Sins againſt him; and the conſideration of the curſed In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude and Diſingenuity that there is in our Sin's, ſure this will when the Spirit ſtrikes it home, open a Vein to purpoſe in a gracious Heart: <hi>Again,</hi> Let us ſee we learn to truſt in him more ſtedfaſtly; we have promiſes and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences too; ſee we truſt him in our Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity; ſee we truſt in him, and not in uncertain riches, friends or the like; and if he bring us into ſtraits again, let us now learn to truſt him then; truſt him for theſe things if they be good for us, however that he will give us that in himſelf which is infinitely better; and ſo lets learn to truſt him for better things; if from his Love he give us Earth, will he not much more give us Heaven, and all that we
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:45231:30"/>need in the way? And then lets ſee we make him the chief object of our delight and joy: <hi>Again,</hi> Let's ſee we be more abundant vigorous and chearful in his Service, in all acts of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Thoſe which more directly reſpect our Brethren; and ſo we muſt ſee we be humble, courtious and affable in our Carriage towards them; and that we do heartily pity and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate them in their Neceſſities and Troubles, and that we do actually relieve and help them, as we have abillity and opportunity, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring that the Lord hath more backs to cloath, more bellies to fill, more hearts to chear with our Proſperity then our own; and as we muſt thus labour to get acquainted with, and then conſcientiouſly and diligently to diſcharge thoſe Duties, and exerciſe thoſe Graces which a proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous Eſtate calls to, and gives us advantage for, with reſpect to others. So,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Thoſe which do more immediately reſpect our ſelves; ſuch as ſelf-denial, moderation, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contentation, a grave and ſober joy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing, weanedneſs from the World, heavenly mindedneſs and the like: But I fear I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged too much, and would fain leave a little room for the laſt thing, and ſo as that I may not ſtreighten others neither. So,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. As we would thus improve our outward Proſperity as hath been confuſedly hinted, we muſt carefully obſerve and follow ſome rules and directions. To name five or ſix.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We muſt labour to get throughly convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of our own Impotency, and utter inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency to do this of our ſelves; and truly we know e'ne nothing of our ſelves, if we know
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:45231:31"/>not this, that of our ſelves without Chriſt we can do nothing; alaſs, we can't bare a Croſs, no more can we handle a ſingle Comfort as we ought; then what ſhall we do in a State of full Proſperity, eſpecially if of any long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance? How certainly it ſinks us into ſecurity, ſenſuallity, worldlineſs, into a neglect of God, our Souls Eternity, and the like if left to our ſelves?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We muſt ſee to it that we be Chriſtians indeed, that we have a thorough work of Grace wrought in our Hearts; there are many Natural carnal Men that know what it is to be in Proſperity, what it is to Abound, but not one of them knows how to Abound, nor can they know any thing of it while they ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue; in the right improving of Proſperity, there are many ſpiritual Acts and Motions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired (as you have heard), but this cannot be without a ſpiritual Principle firſt infuſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Soul; without a gracious Habit, no gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Act; without ſpiritual Life, no ſpiritual Motion; as we were lately inſtructed.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Having Grace we muſt ſee we keep it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake, ſtirring, and in a growing poſture; a Man that hath Life, yet if he fall aſleep, and much more if he fall into a Lethargy or into a Sound outward Motion ceaſeth, even while his Life remains; now and then he breaths al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt inſenſibly, and that's all; ſo it will be with us here; we had need if we would have any work done, keep Grace waking, ſtirring, yea and growing too; O a little Grace will be e'ne loſt in a great heap of worldly ſtuff! Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me, that Chriſtian who hath a great ſhare of outward Proſperity, needs more Grace then his Neighbours; and alaſs for us whoſe ſtock is
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:45231:31"/>ſo low, can we not bleſs God from our Souls, that our outward Proſperity riſeth not ſo high as ſome others doth? I am fully perſwaded ſome of us can, as I am ſure there is reaſon we ſhould.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We muſt labour to maintain and keep up a conſtant watchfulneſs; this is abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary both with reſpect to our Dangers and our Duties, ſo we muſt watch our Hearts, watch our Corruptions, watch our Thoughts, Affections, and our outward Senſes; and ſo we muſt watch Satan and his Temptations; and ſo we muſt watch unto Duty; watch for Calls to ſeaſons of, and advantages for it, that ſo we may take wind and tide when they offer: And ſo we muſt watch our Hearts in duty to ſee that Grace be in its lively and kindly exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We muſt ſee we be not ſtrangers to our Bibles; whatever our Condition be proſperous or adverſe, the Word of God, that's our Pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtar to direct us how to ſtear our courſe; this muſt be a lamp unto our feet, a light unto our paths, for it is not in Man that walketh to direct his ſteps; as ſome of us heard not long ſince; we muſt therefore ſtudy our Bibles, highly prize and diligently attend upon a Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Miniſtry, and improve that with other helps we have to get a thorough underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of, and acquaintance with them.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. And <hi>laſtly,</hi> We muſt ſee the Lord find us much and often upon our Knees, and that in Prayer we be much in the actings and exerciſe of Faith; in this Eſtate, eſpecially if we enjoy it for any time without, ſome conſiderable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruptions, we muſt expect many Dangers and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:45231:32"/>Difficulties; and upon this ground a kneeling (I mean a praying poſture) is far more ſafe and advantagious then to ſtand upon our own Legs; and ſo we muſt be much in the lively exerciſe of Faith on Chriſt, and the promiſes for wiſdom and ſtrength to enable us to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, avoid or cruſh thoſe Temptations, and to mortify thoſe Corruptions, which in this Eſtate we are moſt expoſed to and endangered by, as alſo to diſcharge thoſe duties and exerciſe thoſe Graces, which it gives us ſpecial calls to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities and advantages. For,</p>
                  <p>All this is ſoon ſaid, but to do it will coſt us ſome pains; but I think it is not more then needs, and moreover this we can ſay, Religion is ſo ſweet a thing, that it will more then pay its own coſt and charges even here; O then what will a <hi>[well done good and faithful Servant]</hi> hereafter be? And this with ſuch an <hi>&amp; cetera</hi> as eternal Poſſeſſion can only fully unfold, ſure this will be a reward for all our pains (a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward I ſay, but of free Grace) heaped up and running over.</p>

                  <p>That Love amongſt us is a Duty, it is a thing ſo obvious in it ſelf as we are Brethren and Members one of another, and as it is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject Matter of ſo great a Part of our Bibles, that I think I need not give particular Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances for Proof in ſo plain a caſe.</p>
                  <p>This Love muſt branch it ſelf out into ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſtreams, and diſcover it ſelf ſeveral ways; to inſtance in a particular or two here. And</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We muſt expreſs and exerciſe our Love one to another, in a real hearty Simpathy one with another; weeping with them that weep, and rejoycing with them that rejoyce; as in the natural Body, if one Member ſuffer (be it but a Finger or a Toe) all the reſt ſuffer with it, and ſo on the contrary if one Member be honoured the other Members rejoyce with it; ſo here we ſhould be afflicted in the Afflictions of our Brethren, and rejoyce in their Welfare and Proſperity as our own; in this Senſe, Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions and Mercies ſhould as it were lie in common amongſt us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We muſt do it by denying our ſelves in many caſes for their good, yea in ſome caſes ſo far as to expoſe and actually lay down our Lives for them; as to preſerve the Life of an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently uſeful Miniſter or Chriſtian, in ſome
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:45231:33"/>caſes we ſhould be ready to Sacrifice our own; this is that which ſome have done, and found great Satisfaction in; if a blow threaten my Head or Breaſt, which I know not how to avoid, my Hand is preſently up to receive it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another thing wherein our Duty lies (which is indeed but another way of expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing our Love, and that is), mutual Chriſtian watchfulneſs; that I mean by it is, a concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed eying, obſerving, taking notice of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Eſtates, Conditions, Frames and Carria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; I do not mean a prying into theſe things to ſatisfy Curioſity, or to furniſh us with Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for our vain, idle, unprofitable and ſinful Chat, much leſs to ſatisfy, feed and nouriſh a proud and cenſorious Humour; no, but an endeared brotherly Love muſt here ſet us on work, and manage the matter as a thing neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, in order to our mutual helpfulneſs, one to another. And ſo,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Another thing wherein our Duty lies is, mutual helpfulneſs. And here,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We muſt beware we be at no time found acting the Part of Enemies or falſe Brethren, as to the outward Man and outward Concerns one of another, but eſpecially we muſt beware of doing it as to one anothers Souls, which were to take Satan's part and become his Tools, a thing we were not long ſince awfully warned againſt; O let us take heed of doing any thing at any time to cool, chill and damp one anothers Graces and holy Affections, or of imitating and provoking one anothers Corruptions; and we muſt take heed of doing any thing that may juſtly grieve and ſadden, or lay a ſtumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-block
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:45231:33"/>before one another; and then on the other hand, it concerns us to take heed that we do not through ignorance, infirmity, miſtakes, but above all that we do not through prejudice take offence where it is not juſtly gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We muſt ſee we be poſitively helpful one to another; as in the natural Body the ſeveral Members are mutually helpful and ſerviceable one to another, ſo it ſhould be amongſt us; we muſt ſee we be ſo according to our abilities, opportunities and others neceſſities; look what Talents any of us have of eſtate, parts, gifts, graces, experiences, or whatever elſe is impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable for others good, we ſhould endeavour to make it as a Common-ſtock ſo far as with pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, without pride, ſelf-oſtentation, or ſtretching the line of our places we lawfully may. And,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We muſt endeavour to be mutually help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful one to another, with reſpect to the outward Man, the outward Conditions and Concerns one of another; we muſt be ready to adviſe, counſel, direct, aſſiſt one another with reſpect to theſe; Oh, baſe ſelfiſhneſs amongſt us is an unnatural thing, for lo we be Brethren and Members one of another; and then we muſt alſo relieve ſuch of them as are in Poverty and Want according to our Abilities and Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities; yea, we muſt give more freely more largely to ſuch then to others.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We muſt eſpecially endeavour to be mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually helpful to one anothers Souls; I will humbly adventure to lay down a few things here; I will do little more then name them. And,</p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:45231:34"/>
                  <p n="1">1. Such as have a ſtock of knowledge and ſpiritual underſtanding, the word of Chriſt dwelling richly in them, ſhould be ready to diſperſe it among thoſe that want, ſhould be ready to inſtruct ſuch as are more ignorant and raw, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.16.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is our duty to be often jogging, exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, provoking one another to our Duty, when we are any of us growing dull, ſleepy, careleſs and lukewarm, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.24.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. When any of us are ſteping aſide, or are overtaken with a fault, it is our duty to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh, reprove, reſtore ſuch a one in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Love and Meekneſs, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.17. <hi>Gall.</hi> 6.1. ſuch a poor diſtorted Member muſt be skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and tenderly ſet in joint again.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. When any of our Brethren are ſad, deje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, diſconſolate, of a wounded and ſorrowful Spirit, we ſhould endeavour to comfort and ſtrengthen ſuch feeble minded ones in all their Troubles, with the Comforts wherewith we have been comforted of the Lord, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.4: 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.18. Chap. 5.14.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It is our duty to be mutually helpful one to another in the way of Prayer, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.16. And let the caſe be what it will, Prayer will reach it, becauſe it is the way to engage him that can; and here none of us can reaſonably frame an excuſe who have found the way to Heaven for our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>Give me leave to ſay two Words more:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. All this and more as to Particulars (as I doubt not you will hear) is our Duty, but yet the Lord will take in good Part, will graciouſly accept and reward a ſincere deſire and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, to trade and improve our two Talents
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:45231:34"/>where we have no more; it is my own caſe, and its likely it may as well be ſome of yours; we may be ready under diſcouragement to complain, alaſs, we can do very little, we want Abilities, want Opportunities, we can do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt nothing; well, if there be but in us a willing Mind, witneſſed by ſincere Endeavours, I think we may take this home with us for our Comfort and Encourgement (I do not mean to be idle, ſloathful and careleſs, but chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to fall to work as the Lord ſhall enable us) to wit, that we ſhall be accepted of the Lord according to that which we have, and not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that which we have not; we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily bely our Lord and Maſter, if we ſay or think he is auſteer; the poor Widows mite was not rejected.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As for ſuch as have much riper Parts, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very way larger Abilities and fairer Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties then we, they muſt improve them, but it muſt be their Care to ſee they keep within the compaſs of their Places and Callings, and that they no way encroach upon the Miniſterial Office which the Lord hath paled in by it ſelf; this was very dangerous, and the way to ſpoil all; a Perſon may be very uſeful in a civil So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety in a Kingdom or Commonwealth while he keeps in his proper Poſt; but if he will needs be ſteping up into the Throne he ſpoils all: but I do think none of us may need this Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And then as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid to his Servant <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua,</hi> Numb. 11.29. <hi>Would God that all the Lord's people were Prophets, and that the Lord would put his Spirit upon them;</hi> ſo this I dare ſay for our Men of God, that it would be no Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſore to them, but on the contrary, the joy and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:45231:35"/>rejoycing of their Hearts, to ſee any in their Flock ſtriving, if by any means they might come to be as wiſe and knowing in the great Myſteries of Religion, and every way as Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious as themſelves, and then endeavouring to make what they have (according to the Rules of Chriſtian Prudence and Sobriety) as a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-ſtock to the glory of God, the benefit of their brethrens Souls, and the furtherance of their own Salvation in the day of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</p>

                  <head>
                     <hi>QUESTION IX.</hi> How muſt we Carry towards them that are without?</head>
                  <p>BY them that are without, I here under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, ſuch who though they are within the Pale of the viſible Church, yet are out of Chriſt, and in their Hearts and Lives ſtrangers to the life and power of that Chriſtianity which they ſome way outwardly profeſs; and then I look upon the inward frame and temper of our Spirits, as comprehended in this Caſe, as well as our outward Carriage and Behaviour.</p>
                  <p>So 1. We muſt ſee that we do heartily, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, pity and compaſſionate this their ſad Caſe, a ſadder then which I think I may ſay, is ſcarce to be found on this ſide Hell, though indeed the Caſe of ſome of them is much more ſad then that of others; their Perſons and Caſe call for pity at our hands; they are our fellow Creatures of <hi>Adam</hi>'s race, and not of the tribe of Apoſtate Angels: <hi>Again,</hi> They are Men and Women upon Earth, and not among dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Spirits in Hell; their Caſe is very deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:45231:35"/>and ſuch as once was our own, and though it be not ſo now, yet alſo upon that account it may the rather be expected from us, becauſe we now pretend at leaſt to know better then others do, what God's Favour and his Wrath, what Heaven and Hell, what Salvation and Damnation mean; it is a thing both greatly ſad and ſtrange if we do not pity them; did we ſee any of them hanging by a ſmall Thread over ſuch a place as the mouth of burning <hi>Etna,</hi> would not our Bowels be moved, our Fleſh tremble for them? Their real Caſe is ſadder then ſo; meer Humanity would do much in ſuch a Caſe, will not Grace do more?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We muſt take great heed to our ſelves, that we do nothing to harden them in this their ſad and ſinful Caſe, that we do nothing to keep them where they are; if we pretend to pity them as without, and yet care not wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſhut and bolt the Door upon them, this our pretended Pity is no better then a cruel wicked Lie; and therefore we muſt take heed that by our ſinful Compliance with them, we do not confirm and ſtrengthen them in that good Opinion which alaſs they falſly have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their own ſtate and way: And ſo we muſt take heed of doing any thing that may juſtly prejudice them againſt Religion, againſt the good Ways of God; particular Inſtances are too many to be here inſerted: But in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, every thing that is contrary to the Truth and Purity of Religion, every thing that is contrary to the Scripture Rules of Piety, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, Charity and Sobriety, is carefully to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided by us here.</p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:45231:36"/>
                  <p n="3">3. We muſt ſee that we prudently, conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiouſly, and diligently lay out our ſelves in our places, doing what we can to bring them in. And here,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We muſt endeavour to pray them in; the word is plain here that this is a thing according to God's will; the Lord hath a wonderful great reſpect for and delight in Prayer: And though he hath decreed to do this and that, and though his Providence may be big with it, yet ordinarily before it brings forth Prayer muſt come in, and as it were act the Midwifes part; and this would be much to our own benefit and advantage; Yea, though ſuch and ſuch we pray for ſhould not be brought in, yet being ſincere this our adventure ſhould not be loſt, no but ſhould come richly home, our prayers certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly returning with a bleſſing into our own boſoms.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We muſt do what in us lieth that they may be furniſhed with, and brought unto the ordinary neceſſary means of Salvation; when Perſons are diſtracted, or under any ſuch ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Diſtempers as take away their Senſes and the uſe of their rational Faculties, it is then peculiarly the Part of Friends and Relations to procure them a Phyſician and the neceſſary Means of their Recovery; why the poor Hearts in the caſe before us, they are beſides themſelves, have this and that Death token on them, and are not ſenſible of it, and ſo care not for to look after the Lord Jeſus, his Miniſters, the neceſſary Means of their Salvation, any more then a Man raging Mad in <hi>Bethlem</hi> cares for his Phyſician, or for his neceſſary Preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and then we ſhould endeavour to bring by Perſwaſion ſuch of them as are within our
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:45231:36"/>reach to the Means; and ſuch as are under us as Children and Servants, we may and ought to uſe our Authority with them this way.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We ſhould our ſelves endeavour to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend Religion, its bleſſed Authors ways, means and end unto them. And that,

                  <p n="1">1. With our Mouth's; as we have a call and opportunity, let us be ſpeaking a good Word for God and his good Ways; O they are worthy of it, and we carry it very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily if we do not; and when any of them dare let fly at God and Religion, we ſhould with a holy warmth Vindicate them to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of them againſt any their falſe Charges, their wicked and blaſphemous Lies.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. As a true and real thing; they are ready to look upon Serious Religion as a meer Fancy, a waking Dream of a few weak and ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous People, others as a cunning Plot and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of ſome ſelf-ſeeking Men; tell them of Fellowſhip and Communion with God, they believe no ſuch thing, though we are as ſure of the reality of it from frequent, bleſſed, feeling, convincing, ſweet experience, as of any thing
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:45231:37"/>that ever we ſaw with our Eyes; now let us labour to give them ſome convincing Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Demonſtrations of it, when <hi>Moſes</hi> came down from the Mount with his Face ſhining, no doubt all the People that ſaw him, fully concluded that the Lord and he had been together; you will apply it; We ſpeak of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and of our great Hopes laid up there in their Hearts, they believe there is nothing in it, but are ready to pity, or it may be ſometimes laugh at our weakneſs in laying ſo great ſtreſs upon theſe poor future unſeen things; now let us endeavour by our Carriage in the general Tenour of our Lives, to ſtrike their Hearts with this Conviction, that certainly they muſt be miſtaken, that certainly there muſt be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, reality and life in the buſineſs, we do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſuffering ſuch things (when called to them) in the belief and hopes thereof, and at ſuch a rate as they cannot. So,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let us endeavour to recommend it to them as a practicable and feaſable thing; be Religion true or falſe, yet however they think as theſe Preachers ſet it forth it is Impracticable, and ſo are ready to look on them and us as a company of Hypocrites for pretending to it; O that we did not give them ſo much occaſion here as we do! But however be it known unto them, they charge Religion falſly, our Lord's yoak is another thing then they take it for, eaſy and ſweet all over; and ſuch of us as have had to do with his Croſs have ſaid, and can ſtill ſay as much for that too, or the Fault hath been our own; yea, and they charge us falſly too, as they ſhall know hereafter at leaſt, when they ſhall here our Lord ſay that for us, which
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:45231:37"/>at preſent we have no great Mind to be ſaying for our ſelves; but let us by taking out our Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py before their Eyes, endeavour to convince them while it will do them any good, that to mortify Luſts, repel Temptations, overcome the World, that to deny our Selves, forgive Enemies, bear the greateſt Afflictions from the hand of God, the greateſt Injuries, Reproaches and Sufferings from the hands or tongues of Men, that theſe things and the like, with the Strength which Religion offers and actually af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords to thoſe who do ſincerely embrace it, are not ſuch Matters of Impoſſibility as they take them to be.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That it is a gainful, profitable thing; they think many of them that to become ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly Religious, is the next way to poverty and ruine, the ready way to be undone; alaſs, that they ſhould be ſo miſtaken in Religion, the thing that makes us; <hi>Godlineſs bath the Promiſe of the Life that now is;</hi> whatever they think, it is certainly the ſureſt and the next way to be Rich here, if the Lord ſee it good for one to be ſo; and God be thanked as he hath formerly, ſo he ſtill doth honour Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in the face of the World, by making ſome that are ſincerely, yea exemplarily Good, very conſiderably Great in the World; but however it doth certainly bring the beſt Riches along with it; not the pooreſt Saint in the World, but he hath that which will more then weigh down all the Riches of an Empire; its true, he hath not ſo much lumber as many of them have, but for all that, he hath Riches which cannot be told in a pearleſs Pearl, in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Jewels, in good Bonds; and be it ſo, that
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:45231:38"/>we are moſt of us as Poor as they would have or make us, and may live under much Obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and be little taken Notice of in the World, unleſs it be in a way of Contempt and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, yet let them know we ſcorn the Motion of changing Eſtates with the beſt Man of them all; but they will never give Credit to us, or think that we really believe our ſelves, if they ſee us as diſcontented and uneaſy in and with our outward Conditions, as hot and eager in our purſuit after theſe little trifling Vanities, and as much diſpirited, dejected and heart bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken under any our outward Afflictions, at any our worldly Loſſes, Croſſes and Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as they themſelves in ſuch like caſes are.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. As a creditable, honourable thing; they think that to be called Religious under thoſe ſoul dirty Terms the World hath put upon it, is a real and an intollerable Reproach; if we go to hear theſe pious godly Miniſters, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſerious, O then (ſay they), every one almoſt will deſpiſe, ſpite and trample on us; No; no, you are miſtaken; what ſays wiſe King <hi>Solomon</hi> in this Caſe? [<hi>Exalt her</hi> (that is wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom) <hi>and ſhe ſhall promote thee: She ſhall bring thee to Honour, when thou deſt embrace her; ſhe ſhall give to thine Head an Ornament of Grace, a Crown of Glory ſhall ſhe deliver to thee.</hi>] The Lord is an Honour unto ſuch, as ſome render that, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.7. Theſe are they whom the King will honour, and they are honoured by the wiſeſt and beſt Men upon Earth, yea, by the higheſt principallities and powers in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, nay, they have an honourable Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in the very Hearts and Conſciences of the worſt of Men, their greateſt Enemies ſo far as
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:45231:38"/>they are Men and not turned into meer Bruits; and as for our parts, let them in our Life and Carriage ſee it clearly and abundantly, that we are not aſhamed of our bleſſed Maſter, nor aſhamed of Prayer, or of any Part of his Work, which is truly honourable, both conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in it ſelf, and as it is his: But let them ſee we are of the old Apoſtles mind, who when they would make a high and holy Brag, what ſay they? <hi>I</hi> Paul <hi>a Servant of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Peter <hi>a Servant of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and ſo others of them.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And <hi>laſtly,</hi> Let us invite them in, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring in our Lives to recommend Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to them, as a chearful pleaſant thing; if Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion be real and practicable, and ſome way profitable and creditable; yet, however for pleaſure they think they are the Men, and us, they look upon as a company of poor ſad and melancholly People, and ſo are afraid to caſt in their Lot among us; now let us endeavour to rectify this great Miſtake of theirs alſo, by letting them ſee, <hi>that wiſdoms ways are Ways of Pleaſantneſs;</hi> that it is no rare thing with us to find that ſweet delight, ſatisfaction and joy, in the views and embraces of our Precious, though by them deſpiſed Jeſus, which they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did or can find in any things whatſoever, which they account their topping Enjoyments; though truly where Perſons are under thoſe bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily Diſtempers, which much encline them to dulneſs and ſadneſs, I think as the Lord doth ſo, we and others ſhould give grains of allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; but ſuch ſhould be eſpecially afflicted with and ſtrive againſt ſuch Diſtempers upon this as one main account, as ſome may thence
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:45231:39"/>take occaſion to think more frightfully of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; and ſuch ſhould be very deſirous that others did but know what is many times at their Hearts, even when they may think there is a great deal of ſorrow and heavineſs in their Looks, but eſpecially that they did but know what there is at the heart of Religion; and be it known unto them, even to the greateſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure Mungers of them all, that we have thoſe delights, ſuch pure, ſolid, ſatisfying, and laſting Delights and Joys as they have none; for the truth of which we are ready to pawn our Souls, and all that ever we are worth in the World; yea, and moreover to give them leave to be judges in the caſe themſelves, if ſo be they will but come and make a ſerious tryal of Roli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion as far as we have done, and yet there are far greater Matters ſtill which many others have attained unto, which we are in the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect and purſuit of.</p>

I know a Perſon whoſe experimental Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it is, that the more he doth with humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and thankfulneſs obſerve and take notice of God's gracious Anſwers of Prayer, the more ſweet Matter of that kind the Lord is wont to give him in for his Obſervation.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. As depraved by Sin; and here a great part of our Work lieth; our worſt, moſt miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheivous, dangerous and deadly Enemies ly in our own Boſoms, a helliſh brood of filthy Luſts, which are ever ready to betray and ruine us; Satan indeed hath a great hand in undoing Souls, but the truth is, he might ſpare his Pains, did the Lord but ſtand by, our own Luſts would do the work effectually themſelves; we have reaſon to conclude that we ſhould go to Hell readily enough of our ſelves, did but the Lord ſuſpend, withdraw his Spirit and Grace, and ſo let us go quietly; ſuch Enemies as theſe ſure need watching.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As renewed by Grace; alaſs, Grace in many of our Hearts (I am ſure, I muſt my ſelf ſubſcribe for one), I ſay it is a poor, ſmall, weak and tender thing, if it be not very ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, declining and languiſhing; this poor thing meets with great Oppoſition, a world of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies both within and without, that it is as ſtrange a wonder that it ſhould be kept alive in our Souls, as that a ſpark of Fire ſhould be kept burning in a great quantity of Water; we have need to watch our Graces if we would have them kept alive, and much more if we would have them lively; we muſt watch to the feeding and nouriſhing, to the preſerving
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:45231:41"/>and defending, to the acting and exerciſing, and ſo to the increaſing and ſtrengthening of them in our Souls; we muſt watch over our inward Man.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Over our outward Man; over our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Senſes; O how much Sin and Vanity is almoſt contiunally either coming in or going out that way unleſs ſtreightly watched! We have need to ſet a ſtrict watch, a ſtrong guard upon each of them; and ſo we read of holy <hi>Job</hi>'s making a Covenant with his Eyes, and of <hi>David</hi>'s ſetting a watch at the door of his Lips. And ſo we have need to watch as to the whole of our outward Carriage and Behaviour, to ſee that it be ſuch as becometh the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We muſt watch over our two grand E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies without us, Satan and the World; Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan in his Temptations; He is ſuch a ſubtil, powerful, cruel and malicious Enemy, hath ſo many Snares for us, and is ſo good at the chooſing and at the laying of them, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out extraordinary care and watchfulneſs, it is in an ordinary way impoſſible that our Souls ſhould in any tollerable manner eſcape him. And ſo the World is a near, a preſent and very miſchievous Enemy to our Souls; we have need to watch the Men of the World, and the Things of the World, both good and evil, for we are endangered by them all; thus we muſt manage our watch univerſally.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Diligently; ſo the Charge runs, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.13. And the truth is our Caſe is ſuch, that its abſolutely neceſſary it ſhould be ſo; without diligence in our watch we do nothing, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever that which is next to it, a Town that is
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:45231:41"/>cloſely beſieged by a potent Enemy, that hath alſo within its Walls a ſtrong treacherous Party, ever watching for an opportunity to betray it to the Enemy without; ſure ſuch a Town had need to keep a diligent watch; the caſe ſtands thus with our poor Souls.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Wiſely and Prudentially; one might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance here in many things, I will hint only in a few touching the Corruptions of our own Hearts, and the Temptations of Satan; we muſt watch Sin, ſo we muſt wiſely obſerve and watch the firſt motions and ſtirrings of it to ſuppreſs them, watch the occaſions of Sin to avoid them, watch to cut of that which feeds our Luſts; we ſee how vigilant and induſtrious Men are to cut of Supplies from an Enemy with whom they are engaged in War. This is a great piece of Spiritual Policy alſo; we muſt watch all Sin in general, but above all our ſpecial Sins; ſo we muſt watch Satan in all his Temptations, but eſpecially in that which is as it were his Maſter-piece; we muſt watch at all times, but eſpecially at ſuch times as uſe to be moſt critical and dangerous ones with us, with reſpect to the Prevalency of Corruptions and Temptations, as ſuch as are Perſons of any tollerable Obſervation, may find that there are ſometimes more critical and dangerous with them this way then others.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Prayer fully; the truth is, whatever Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Work we take in hand, humble, fervent, believing Prayer, muſt come in at one End, or we are like to make but poor Work of it; and as to this of Watchfulneſs in particular; if we do not thus engage the Lord to watch over our watchings, all will be but labour in vain;
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:45231:42"/>our Lord knew full well what he did, when he linked theſe two together in his Charge <hi>[watch and pray.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. And to add no more, it muſt be conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and perſeveringly; while we are here we are in our enemies Country, and ſo are never out of danger, and therefore we ſhould never let down our watch; but here lieth the miſery of it which undoes us, though at ſometimes we may make Conſcience of this Duty, yet by and by, we grow careleſs and ſecure, let down our watch, and ſo we looſe our ſelves extreamly, and let our vigilant Enemies get great advantage againſt us; and moreover ſome of us may find our bad Hearts moſt prone to this after the greateſt enlargments in the exerciſe of Grace, or after the largeſt incomes of the ſpiritual Joy and Comfort; but alaſs this is perfect nonſenſe in Religion, for this is one time in which we are in the greateſt Danger, and ſo a ſpecial Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for the ſtricteſt watch; at ſuch a time the Devil hath the moſt aking Tooth at us, and bears us the greateſt Malice and revengful Spite.</p>
                  <p>Thus we muſt endeavour to manage this Duty, obedientially, univerſally, diligently, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, prayerfully, conſtantly and perſevering<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; this is eaſily ſaid, but not ſo eaſily done; we muſt remember that ſerious Religion is a Labour and a Miſtery, but withal for our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, that it is the moſt Honourable, Pleaſant and Profitable one, and that in it we have not to do with ſuch a hard Task-maſter as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was, who required full Tale of Brick, yet would not allow the People Straw.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> A Preparation for Parting with RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LATIONS.</head>
               <p>I Am convinced, that an entire, humble and chearful Reſignation of my Will to the Will of God, manifeſted in the all-wiſe and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Diſpoſals of his Providence towards me, is both my Duty and great Felicity: And that I am bound to labour after ſuch a Frame, when under the ſadeſt of his Diſpenſations. I have reaſon to conclude, that the loſs of near and dear Relations will ſet me hard; indeed God hath hitherto wonderfully indulged me in this Matter, that I have not yet known by Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience what ſuch Tryals are: But I cannot in the Courſe of Nature reaſonably expect to be long exempted from them, therefore cannot but look upon it as a great piece of Wiſdom to get armed and prepared for them; and here I think it may not prove an unprofitable fruitleſs Labour, to draw up ſome ſuch weighty Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, as may tend to work up my Heart to the Frame forementioned, that ſo I may have them in readineſs againſt that time when I ſhall find my ſelf very unfit and indiſpoſed for ſuch a work; and here I am the more confirmed, when I reflect upon the late diſturbance of my Mind, when the Lord was pleaſed to bring my dear Father exceeding low, even ſo low that I concluded it had been juſt at the parting pinch, whoſe Death I will here ſuppoſe; yet would I beware of the contrary Extream, a Stoical Frame and Diſpoſition, being contrary
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:45231:43"/>both to the Principles of Piety and Humanity.</p>
               <p>Here I would conſider,</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1ſt.</hi> The ſupream, full, and abſolute Right and Propriety which God hath in me, and in all which I call mine; <hi>the Earth is the Lord's, and the fulneſs thereof:</hi> The World, and all they that dwell therein; a little while ſince I was not, even till God made me: And every moment I ſhould drop into my Primitive no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, did he not powerfully and graciouſly Suſtain me; beſides, I am by Sin expoſed to thoſe Miſeries which are more deplorable then Annihilation it ſelf, from which he hath by a miracle of wiſdom, condecenſion and love re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed me; from hence its evident, that I am not my own, but his: So neither do I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy any thing, which I can ſtrictly and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly call my own; no thing's ſo mine, but that he hath a clearer Right, and juſter Claim un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it; I received all at the Hands of his Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and am to poſſeſs only during his Pleaſure; though he hath conferred many Favours upon me, yet I am to remember this, that he hath not given away his own Right: No, his Right in his Creatures is unalienable; hath the Lord now reſumed one of my deareſt Comforts, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away my Father? Is not this one Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration enough to juſtify him, and calm and quite me. May not the Lord do what he will with his own? And was he not his more then mine? His Creature, his Child, his Miniſter? O let me dread mutining againſt his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, but be in ſubjection to him the Father of Spirits, and live! Let me think with my ſelf, it is the Lord, and let his Excellency make me afraid! <hi>Be ſtill, and know that he is
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:45231:43"/>God, be dumb, not opening my Mouth becauſe he hath done it! For who am I, that I ſhould ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernly contend with my Maker, who is the Lord of all?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2dly.</hi> The Righteouſneſs of God in all his Diſpenſations towards me; though he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times doth Afflict, yet he doth not, he cannot wrong me; had he not freely engaged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he had been free from all Engagements to the moſt innocent Creatures, ſo that he might have annihilated them, or uſed them at his Pleaſure without the leaſt ſhew of wrong or injuſtice: Hath not the Potter power over the Clay? But alaſs, I am a ſinful, guilty Wretch; as I received all at the Hands of his free Grace and Favour, ſo have I forfeited all into the Hands of his Juſtice; hath the Lord now taken the Forfeiture of this choice Mercy at my Hands? I ought ſurely to aſcribe Righteouſneſs to my Maker; doubtleſs Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs eſtabliſheth his Throne; the Juſtice and Equity of his Laws, and of his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence are equally unqueſtionable: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhould I fear as by Diſobedience to reflect upon the one, ſo by Impatience upon the other; would not Conſcience preſently ſtep in, inſtead of a thouſand Witneſſes againſt me, ſhould I once dare to think God Unrighteous in this ſad Diſpenſation? Will not my Relative ſins (beſides an innumerable Multitude of others, together with the Corruption of my Nature which I brought with me into the World, from whence all proceedeth) be enough to ſtop my Mouth? O! Have I not rather cauſe humbly to admire at the abundance of Mercy that is mixed with the heavieſt Afflictions, that
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:45231:44"/>at any time light upon me here? Cauſe to ſtand and wonder that I am not made as Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable as Miſery it ſelf, as Hell it ſelf can make me? Surely the Lord puniſheth me far leſs then mine Iniquities have deſerved, otherwiſe I had long ſince been in Hell amongſt Devils and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Spirits; as in point of Obedience, the Lord is now graciouſly pleaſed to accept of far leſs then is his dew, ſo in point of Suffering I have far leſs then is mine: And therefore ſhould I patiently ſubmit unto, humbly and thankfully accept of the preſent Puniſhment of mine Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities; it is my Duty to bear the Indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Lord graciouſly (and good reaſon why I ſhould) becauſe I have ſinned againſt him.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>3dly.</hi> As his Right and Righteouſneſs are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable, ſo his Power is irreſiſtible; He doth whatſoever he will both in Heaven and Earth, and there is none that may ſtay his Hand, <hi>or ſay to him what doſt thou?</hi> Sure then it were folly and madneſs with a witneſs, for me to enter a conteſt with him. Am I ſtronger then he? It is my wiſdom to meddle with my Match, but wo unto me, if thus I ſtrive with my Maker; Ah, how eaſily he who could make the World with a word of his Mouth, and doth but look upon the Earth and it trembleth, how eaſily he could cruſh me! I am but a little breathing duſt, he would ſurely blow me away with a blaſt of his Noſtrils; what would the combined Forces of the whole Creation be in the Hands of the om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent God, to whom Power belongs? He could frown all into a confuſed Chaos in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; how eaſy is it then for him to deal
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:45231:44"/>with me? Let me think ſoberly what the Event of the Matter will be; <hi>who ever hardened himſelf againſt God and proſpered,</hi> what am I like to get by my impatient, unſubmiſſive Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage? Nothing ſure, unleſs it be redoubled and heavier ſtrokes; what more like then this farther to inſenſe him? Will he put up ſo vile an Affront? Rather will he not humble me to purpoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he hath done, and make me know who I am, a ſilly worm, yea ſinful duſt and aſhes, and what it is for a Creature, yea a Hell de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving wretch to fly in the Face of Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency it ſelf? A principle of ſelf Preſervation, is common to the very Bruits; ſure then the Rational Soul is not without it: Where is it then, am I utterly bereaft of it? If not, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks that ſhould effectually perſwade me to ſubmit, and humble my ſelf under God's migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Hand, as a courſe more eligible by far, then by my proud and ſtubborn Reſiſtance, even to force him (as he tenders his own honour and loveth me,) to ſpend more Rods upon my Back; yea, to force him from Rods to Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions: Let ſanctified Reaſon poſſeſs its Throne, and lay a law of ſilence both upon Heart and Mouth, that ſo (the diſorderly Motions of my unruly Paſſions being regulated) I may inſtead of charging God fooliſhly with my Lips, in this and in every thing give thanks.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <hi>4thly.</hi> This Diſpenſation though ſad yet is the product of infinite Wiſdom; which ſhould be a powerful Argument to move me with humble Submiſſion to ſubſcribe unto it: The King immortal, is alſo the only Wiſe God; none originally, eſſentially, and infinitely Wiſe but he: This attribute of his, he hath wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:45231:45"/>diſplayed; have I not ſometimes been filled with wonder and admiration, at the thoughts of his Wiſdom manifeſted in the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the World. Though I am ſuch a poor ſhallow Creature, able to comprehend ſo little, ſo very little of it; O, what a wiſe, intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Being muſt he needs be, who hath crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Heaven and Earth, with all the Creatures their inhabitants, in ſuch variety, excellency and harmony! How great and marvellous are thy Works, O Lord! Thy infinite Wiſdom is Engraven in plain and legible Characters, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the face of the whole Creation, ſo that he that runs may read; and now I am to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that its the ſame God who at firſt made all things, that doth order and diſpoſe of them in his Providence, and as he hath, ſo he doth, and ever will act like himſelf; all his Works are perfect, all his Ways are judgment; O, the Divine Miſteries that are in the Works of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence! Full little do I think what the all Wiſe God may now be doing with me; my thoughts of this ſad Providence may be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully altered, when the Lord ſhall pleaſe to open the Matter more fully to me; O what a day will that be, when the Lord will unriddle all his Providences to his Servants, and rectify all our Miſtakes about them, clearly diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their ſweet harmonious Contribution to his own glory and our good? <hi>Thy thoughts are not our thoughts, nor thy ways are not our ways;</hi> O Lord, how little did <hi>Joſeph</hi> think of his high Advancement, which the Lord was make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing way for, when he was ſold as a Salve into <hi>Egypt,</hi> or when he was in Priſon there? He hath a thouſand ways to bring his own Glory,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:45231:45"/>and his Peoples Good out of the heavieſt Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and moſt diſmal Diſpenſations that at any time they are under, and he not only can but will do it; its uſual with him to bring light out of darkneſs, good out of evil, meat out of the devourer, ſweetneſs out of the ſtrong; O therefore let me ſtand ſtill, and with ſilent Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, contemplate the Wiſdom of God in the various Methods of his Providence: But let me not quarrel with him, or find fault with any of his doings! Can I mend them? I dare not ſpeak ſuch Blaſphemy, as to ſay I can: But is not my Heart full of impatient, diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, fretful, furious, or at leaſt dejected Thoughts: If ſo, the Lord whoſe ſole Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative it is to ſearch and try the Heart, cannot but know it, and knowing, will <hi>certainly bring me to Judgment for them;</hi> he is as well acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with my moſt inward, deep and ſecret Thoughts, as others can be with my outward Expreſſions and Behaviour, being nearer to me then I am to my ſelf: And he takes moſt No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of them, they being the trueſt and moſt certain Indication of my Mind; one may beſt judge of the Spring, by the Water which doth immediately iſſue forth; and as a Man think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in his Heart, even ſo is he: O fooliſh wretch! Shall I in my Peeviſhnefs, enter a Diſpute with Wiſdom it ſelf? Who am I, that dare thus to darken Counſel, with Words with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Knowledge? For this thing let me abhor my ſelf, and repent in duſt and aſhes: And for the future be dumb and not open my Mouth becauſe the All-wiſe God hath done it.</p>

               <p n="5">
                  <hi>5thly.</hi> The conſideration of that amiable At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute of God, his Goodneſs, ſhould work much upon me; God is Love, a moſt ſweet Notification of the ever bleſſed Deity; he is not a being that ſporteth himſelf with his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures Miſery: <hi>He doth not afflict willingly, nor grieve the Children of Men,</hi> much leſs his own Children; Judgment is his ſtrange Work, but Mercy pleaſeth him: <hi>His tender Mercies are over all his Works,</hi> and I have taſted abundantly of them; O how highly Injurious I am to ſo ſweet and amiable a Being, if I entertain hard and black thoughts of him! <hi>He hath cauſed goodneſs and mercy to follow me, he hath done me good and not hurt all the days of my life,</hi> and ſhall I now bury the grateful Remembrance of all former Mercies in my Father's Grave? <hi>How many Mercies and Comforts he yet continues to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford me?</hi> More then I can eaſily reckon up: And ſhall I in my Frowardneſs caſt away all (as it was), becauſe he hath reſumed Part? O let me beware of ſuch fooliſh Ingratitude! Farther, If I take a ſerious and impartial view of this Affliction, I ſhall find this bitter Cup is allayed and ſweetned with much Mercy; it is not a Cup of Vengance, the ſtroke not purely Vindictive; its not the Wound of an Enemy, nor the Chaſtizement of a Cruel one: No, the Rod is in a Father's hand; he is a God that changeth not, and ſo a Father when he ſtrikes, as well as when he ſtroaks: What is his Deſign in this Affliction? Aſſuredly he intends me Good and not Evil; by this means he would ſet my Heart more againſt Sin, cauſing me to taſte of its Bitterneſs: And wean me more from the Creature, ſhewing me its vanity and

Is not that good Phyſick which is a means to cure ſuch mortal Diſtempers, and he a good Phyſician who doth preſcribe and give it, though in it ſelf it be a bitter Potion? But farther, as his Deſign is Gracious in ſending this Affliction, ſo his Providence exerciſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it is very Compaſſionate; this ſtroke might have come with many more ſad and aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Circumſtances, he might have given me a larger Doſe, but like a wiſe and merciful Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, he conſidereth my Strength; or, he might have left me to my ſelf, to have ſunk under this heavy Preſſure: But behold, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath is his ſupporting Arm; he helps to bear the Burthen himſelf lays on: And when is it ſo well with me, when have I ſo much of God, when do I enjoy ſuch ſweet incomes from the Spirit, as then, when all things look black and dark about me in the World? Its ordinarily God's uſe to know me, my felicity to enjoy him moſt, in the time of my greateſt Adverſity; O therefore let me kiſs that Rod, which is bound up with ſo much love.</p>

Sure either I do not know him, or elſe my intereſt in him is doubtful, or I am incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate, not truly weighing my Happineſs in him: Ah, what a poor Creature ſhould I be, had nothing but a God left me! Why, what would I have more? To have God, is as much as to have God and all the World; have I him? O then I have all in him! I am ready to cry out, <hi>wo is me, for I am broken with a grievous breach this day!</hi> Ah, my loſs how great it is? I have loſt a loving, tender hearted, careful Father; one that had not only the name and relation, but the heart and bowels of a Father as well: How ſolicitous he was for my Welfare? What care he took for my temporal Welfare, but eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially, how concerned he was for my Soul? O! Methinks, I have ſometimes ſeen even his very Heart in his Prayers, Counſels, Warnings, Reproofs, yea and Corrections too; but now I am at once deprived of all: O ſad loſs! Why true, my loſs is very Great, it pincheth ſore; it is my Duty to be ſenſible of it, and much affected with it: But hold, what is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of my God, of my heavenly Father? <hi>He is yet alive, and behold he lives for evermore:</hi> Let it be with me here, as it was with <hi>Jacob</hi> of Old; when he was convinced that his Son <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> was alive, the good old Man, his Spirit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived within him, and ſo let mine upon this Conſideration, and let me ſay with him it is enough: Is it not he that hath cared for me all this while, and may I not humbly and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently rely upon him ſtill? Is he not the ſame

What, though this inſtrument and the other be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved out of the way? He never wants Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to do his Work; he can either make uſe of new Ones, or do his Work without them; when his People are in Diſtreſs, if he ſee it good, he can and will create Deliverance for them, and that's a Work done without a Tool: I, but what will become of that poor Family? What will become of poor Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? Why, by Faith and Prayer let me com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them all to the ſame God, who will look after and provide for them too; I have great Incouragement thus to do, whether I look at him, or them; the little knowledge I have of him may aſſure me, that they cannot be in bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Hands: He wants neither Wiſdom, Power nor Will to do them good; under his Fatherly care and cuſtody, they are ſure to want no good Thing, which is conſiſtent with his Love to beſtow, and their real Benefit to enjoy; and are ſecured here from all real and deſtructive Evils: It ſeems on purpoſe to ſtrengthen the Faith, and revive the Souls of his poor Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures under ſuch Tryals, that he hath taken upon him thoſe ſweet relative Titles, of a Father, a Husband.— <hi>Again,</hi> If I look at them, I have farther Incouragement, having a comfortable Aſſurance of the ſpecial covenant Intereſt that the moſt of them have in this God, and a good Hope concerning the reſt; now let God alone, he loves and will take care of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: Let me not at once both grieve and diſhonour him, and torment my ſelf with my Diſtruſt! But farther, the loſs is Publick; O
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:45231:48"/>my Father, the Chariots of <hi>England,</hi> and the Horſe men thereof! God's poor Church hath loſt a judicious, faithful and painful Miniſter; how many poor Souls that may want him! How will that poor Place where he lived want him? Well, though here is a wide gap made, yet ſure, ſuch a God can fill and ſtop it up; which of the Prophets live for ever? <hi>God that ſends his Servants appoints them their Work, and when they have done that, they muſt away and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers come in their room:</hi> He will not have all his Work done by one Miniſter, or in one Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, but by a Succeſſion of ſuch in his Church to the end of the World; ſo this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Servant of his having acted his Part, is gone down, to make way for ſuch as the Lord ſhall ſend; having diſpatched the Work given him to do, he is gone to his Great Lord and Maſter to receive an ample Reward: And ſtill God's Church while upheld (that is ſo long as the World ſtands) ſhall be provided for.</p>

O this evil Heart of Unbelief! Well, I now ſee a poor cold dead Carkaſe, but what's
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:45231:48"/>become of the Soul, which did a while ſince animate it? No doubt it is with Chriſt in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radice; O thrice happy Soul indeed! Methinks while I am ſadly lamenting my own Loſs, I ſhould alſo rejoyce in his Gain, which is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivably greater; he is now poſſeſſed of that State of Bliſs, which he hath ſometimes ſo ſweetly deſcribed to us: But how ſhall I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed here? My conceptions of this bleſſed State, how low, dark, imperfect and confuſed are they? But let not the Lord be angry; he is now perfectly freed from all thoſe groſs Evils and Miſeries which poor we Mortals are encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed with; he hath now at once bid farewel to Sin and Sorrow both for ever: What grievi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous complaints I have heard ſometimes coming from his Mouth, by reaſon of his Corruptions and Imperfections, though he had compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively ſo little Reaſon? But now I know his Note is changed; He crieth out of a naughty Heart no more, being received into the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Juſt ones made perfect; He is no more afflicted with perplexing Doubts and Fears; His ſhaking Fits are all over; A ſweet ſerenity of Mind he ordinarily enjoyed indeed while here, but now his Peace is perfect and uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted; Poſſeſſion hath put his Title quite out of doubt; He is no more caſt down under a Senſe of God's diſpleaſure; He ſeeth a Frown in his bleſſed Face no more, he complains no more, the Lord is angry with me; He is no more annoyed and diſquieted with Satan's Temptations, being got quite out of his Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot; That old Serpent is now troden under his Feet, ſo as never to hiſs, or put forth his Sting at him more; For temptations he hath
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:45231:49"/>an everlaſting triumph; He is now got above a vain, tempting and vexing World; How lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle he regards this worldly Traſh, now he is got poſſeſſed of the heavenly Treaſure? How he would diſdain, yea abhor any Solicitations from the World, was he in their reach? Draw him away from his God with a toy, a ſhadow? O vile and vain Attempt! He knows better things then ſo; The rule of the greateſt Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire upon Earth, is far below the meaneſt of his heavenly Companions, thrice happy Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures be they all! And as for a raging, perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting World, he fears it no more for ever; let his Enemies touch him now with their Scorns, Reproaches and Callumnies if they can: Which of them will impriſon, impoveriſh or baniſh him now? Its a thing quite out of all their hands; in his Conflict here, he was exemplary for his Faith, Patience and other Graces: And now he hath obtained a full and final Conqueſt, and with it a Crown of Glory which fadeth not: He is now perfectly freed from all other ſad effects and conſequents of Sin; He is no more ſeen in Tears, and ſad Complaints: Grief no more finds a paſſage into his bleſſed Soul; fears no more darken his Delights: He is no more conſumed with Cares; He crieth out of a pained Head or Side, of a ſick Stomack, or of weak and feeble Limbs no more for ever; He is no more heard complaining of languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, unſerviceable Weakneſs, which hath ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times been ſo great a burden to him: All his dolourous Hours, all his weary Nights and Day's are over and paſt; the Lord hath won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully changed Chear with him: Behold, for paternal corrections, the higheſt expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:45231:49"/>of fatherly Love and Affection! The rod having done its work is quite laid aſide, and he is taken into the lap; and as all his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Troubles both inward and outward are at an End, ſo all relative and publick ones, of which he was wont to have no ſmall ſhare, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one of a truly tender, compaſſionate and publick Spirit: He is now no more ſadned and grieved with this Friends ſinful Miſcariage, or that Friends heavy Affliction; He is now got out of the ſound of the Churches Sufferings: Many a ſad ſight he had ſeen, and many doleful tideings he hath heard concerning the Church of Chriſt, which have deeply affected him with Grief and Sorrow, the intereſt of a dear Redeemer lying very near his Heart; but now no more of this for ever: He is otherwiſe now taken up; having wept freely with thoſe that wept here on Earth, he is now rejoycing much more abundantly with triumphant ones above; O happy Soul indeed! But this is not all, may I therefore proceed a little farther? And the good Lord pardon my great Sin, the wrong I do thee in diſparaging thy magnificent Bounty, darkening rather then otherwiſe the Glory of thy heavenly Kingdom, and his Felicity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in with my inadaequate Conceptions, unſuitable Affections, and low Expreſſions! But what bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter can be expected from ſo ſinful a Soul in Fleſh? Lord, when thou admitteſt me to taſt of the Tree of Life my ſelf, I ſhall have other kind of thoughts, and be able to give another account of it? I am now thinking, what a ſweet Story ſome Angel or glorified Saint could tell me concerning the heavenly State, who could thus ſpeak from Experience! Well, he is
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:45231:50"/>now with them made perfect; He is not only freed from ſinful Imperfections, but hath his Capacity inlarged for the Reception of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Glory; we are poor narrow-mouthed, ſhallow Creatures, little that we can take in or or hold: What would Heaven be to us in our preſent State? But its otherwiſe with him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing raiſed to as high a degree of Perfection as he is capable of; and according to his Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivety are his Enjoyments: His large Veſſels are filled brim full in the Ocean of eternal Bliſs; He is got to the neareſt enjoyment of God your chief Good: And what need I, or can I ſay more? O that I did but know, experimentally know what thus much meaneth! Bleſſed Soul he doth by ſweet Experience, being got as near him as he can well deſire; He now knoweth God indeed, <hi>the knowledge of whom in Chriſt is life-eternal:</hi> Indeed the eſtrangedneſs which Sin had created between God and his Soul, was hapily removed in a good-meaſure while here, ſo that he had much ſweet entercourſe with him; but alaſs! It was but in part, but this is done away, that which is perfect, being come; while he was here, he ſaw but through a glaſs darkly (as poor we do) but now Face to Face: And having this knowledge of God, what can he be ignorant of which is worth the knowing, or would any way augment his Happineſs? And doubtleſs it would add much to his Joys, now he is got to the heavenly <hi>Canaan,</hi> to reflect, and look back upon the many weary turns and windings which he had in his Paſſage through the howling Wilderneſs of this World; but that which is ſweeter ſtill, indeed the kernel of all is, he now enjoyeth God in the perfect
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:45231:50"/>and conſtant actings of joyful Love; while we are forced to breath out many a ſad complaint of the diſaffection of our Souls towards God, he is breathing out nothing but love and joy and praiſe; now he had perfected Affections, and a perfect ſight of his Aimableneſs, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally enjoyeth the ſweet embraces of his Love, its a thing impoſſible for him either not to love him, or to love him with ſuch remiſneſs, cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and inconſtancy as poor unworthy we do; and perfectly to love God, and to be beloved of him, this perfect, mutual and joyful Love (I think) is the higheſt happineſs the Creature is capable of: O bleſſed Soul! How pure and perfect are his Joy's? What ſhall I ſay to theſe things? O that I could feel more! He hath changed his quarters indeed! Glorious Angels and Saints are now his Familiar's, his continual Aſſociates, which when he beareth a part in thoſe heavenly Songs of Praiſe to him that ſits upon the Throne, and to the Lamb for ever and ever; O bleſſed Place, bleſſed Work and bleſſed Company! In a few words (as he defined it to us while here) he is now perfectly freed from all Sin and Miſery, in the fruition of all good, being perfectly reſtor'd to God's Image, and admitted to the beatifical Viſion and Fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition of him, in the moſt glorious Fellowſhip with Chriſt the head of our recovery, and all the holy Angels and bleſſed Saints in Heaven; O famous Deſcription! And yet the one half is not told us; now ſhall I be ſo unkind as once to wiſh him back again with me? Should I not rather long to be with him, and in the mean time think well of the Rod, which is a bleſſed means to drive me forward in Heavens
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:45231:51"/>way? Should I not with humble Submiſſion en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain this, and all other afflictive Providences, which may exceedingly befriend me in my Preparation for that bleſſed Place and State.</p>

I am to conſider that its only the Fleſh that is the looſer here, and that but for a time, which loſs ſhall be made up with unſpeakable advantage at the great Day of the Lord, which draws on; Death to his Soul, was his preſent inſervicable Gain, as before: And why ſhould I be ſo immoderately concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for what the body ſuffers? Alaſs! What was it but a lump of Corruption? Indeed while that gracious Soul of his did animate it, it was very lovely, of much value: But now the Jewel is gone, what is the Cabinet worth? Good reaſon why I ſhould take delight in that Houſe though but of Clay, while the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Inhabitant was there: But now its gone, and Houſe is fallen in, why ſhould I ſo value it? And farther, what was it to him, what an Enemy? How much care and labour, grief and ſorrow it hath coſt him? A log, a priſon
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:45231:51"/>to his Soul; I may be ſure he doth not grieve or grudge, that God hath now by Death thus disburdened, unfettered, and releaſed him: But farther, I am to conſider that Jeſus Chriſt the Lord of Life, hath vanquiſhed and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Death; if Death had ſwallowed him up, had made an end of him, this had been ſad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but God be thanked it is otherwiſe: He had a firm Belief of this great Truth, and the Comfort of it too, for in his late Sickneſs when he called me to Pray by him, he bid me bleſs God for a Mediator, through whom he could ſay, <hi>O death where is thy ſting? O grave where is thy victory?</hi> The Lord Jeſus Chriſt is riſen from the dead, a main part of the glad tidings which the Goſpel brings, which is good aſſurance of the bleſſed Reſurrection of all thoſe that belong to him; let me think oft of thoſe ſweet Words of his <hi>[becauſe I live, ye ſhall live alſo.]</hi> To be ſure the Lord Jeſus Chriſt the head of his Church, will not have a dead Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, no nor one dead Member, while it is in his Power to give it Life; as ſure as he is riſen from the Dead, and lives for ever more (which is as ſure as that God is True, who hath decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it in his <hi>Word</hi>) ſo ſure it is that whoſoever believing his ſhall be raiſed by him at the laſt day, and live for ever with him: Now think, I have many a time chearfully bid him Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, when he hath been going to take his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural reſt, and why? Becauſe I hoped to ſee him again in the Morning, and that more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed: And why ſhould I grieve immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately now? His grave is but a bed wherein to reſt his weary Bones for a while, and I may not only hope, but have a confident well
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:45231:52"/>grounded Aſſurance, that the Morning of the Reſurrection will come, when the earth ſhall diſcloſe him, and the duſt cover him no more; this ſhall not be an everlaſting Night, an end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Sleep; No, his Body ſhall be raiſed, and that a glorious, ſpiritual Body: That bleſſed Day will e're long dawn; and how ſweet will be the Salutation between that lovely couple, his glorified Soul and Body, perfectly delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in each other, without jarring in the leaſt for ever more? And how happy a meeting it will be for me, when I ſhall ſo meet with him, as never to be parted from him more? O! I ſhall have enough of his company in Heaven, and it will be better to me there, then it was here; if it hath been ſo comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſpend <hi>Sabbath</hi>'s, and <hi>Solemn-day</hi>'s of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation and Thankſgiving with him here? What will it then be to ſpend an everlaſting <hi>Sabbath</hi> with him in Heaven, in ſinging forth the high Praiſes of God, and of the Lamb? Sure I ſhould not be ſo dejected with the ſad thoughts of parting here, as comforted with the joyful hopes of that bleſſed meeting? Well, the time is coming on a pace; the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is riſen from the dead, the firſt Fruits of them that ſleep, and by and by the Trumphet ſounds, and that quickning Voice which will make dead and dry Bones live <hi>[Ariſe ye dead]</hi> will be heard all the World over! Then ſhall all the Faithful ariſe out of their Graves, with Bodies made like unto Chriſt's Glorious Body: Now what ſay I to theſe things? Believe I this? I have cauſe to be extream jealous of this naughty Heart of mine, which I have ſo often found tardy; and I may be ſure of this, that

Would not ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Reaſon utterly condemn it? I am not the firſt by Millions that have been in this Caſe; how many if I conſider, that in a ſhort time I may reckon up, and ſuch as upon ſundry Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, might have promiſed themſelves an exemption from this tryal of Affliction before me, and yet it came upon them, and yet with ſuch aggravating Circumſtances as mine doth not; many have been ſnatched away ſuddenly, and ſuch as they had juſt cauſe to fear was in their natural, unregenerate Eſtate: But I have had a fair time of warning to prepare my ſelf, and as to his good Eſtate God-ward, better aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance I could not well deſire; and what ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thou? How wouldeſt thou have eſcaped the ſtroke? Why I would have gone firſt: By the way, I doubt my deſires after Heaven are not rightly grounded; I fear I do not truly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire Heaven, and ſo am not like to come there ever the ſooner for ſuch deſires, if it be only or chiefly that I may be eaſed of, or eſcape and avoid Afflictions here; was I the moſt miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:45231:53"/>Creature in the World, yet the thoughts of being rid of Corruption and Temptation, thus freed from Sin, this ſhould make Heaven more deſirable to me, then the being eaſed of all my miſeries here: But to return; was not he more fit for Heaven by far than I, more ripe for Glory, more meet for the Inheritance of the Saints in light? And is it not a thing very fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and equal that he ſhould go firſt? Since he hath been ſo hard at work, and ſo quick in the diſpatch of it, why ſhould I think much that the Lord ſhould give this his laborious Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant a writ of eaſe, admitting him into his reſt, before ſuch an idle, lazay, loiterer as <hi>I?</hi> Your young Scholars who have made ſome good proficiency in Learning at your Country Schools, are ſent to the Univerſity: But what ſhould dull raw School boy's do there? They muſt be whipt and whipt again, before they will learn to ſay their Leſſons; juſt ſo its here: The Lord Jeſus Chriſt the great Doctor of his Church, hath kept him a conſiderable time at his School here on Earth, and very teachable he was, he had learnt to take out his Leſſon exceeding well, few ſo good at it as he, he had learnt Chriſt indeed, and ſo being ripe, he is gone to take his Degrees in the Univerſity of Heaven: Whereas, ſuch a dull, blockiſh, ſot as <hi>I,</hi> ſuch a loiterer, who love my eaſe and my play better then my book; am like to have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a frown and many a blow, many a whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bout before <hi>I</hi> can follow him, or come where he is, if ever <hi>I</hi> come there; if <hi>I</hi> hold on this idle, lazy rate, Thouſands will get the ſtart of me, will get to Heaven before me, while <hi>I</hi> lie loitering behind, if <hi>I</hi> do not in the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:45231:54"/>end fall ſhort of it; why true, <hi>I</hi> muſt grant that he was more fit for Heaven then I, and that God's ways are equal in taking them firſt, who are moſt ſpeedy in their Preparations: But O that he would have ſpared him a little longer! Would he but have lengthned out his Life one Year more! Yea, how thankful would I have been for one Month, or one Week more? But one Day, one Hour will not be granted; He is gone, ſo that I muſt never ſee his Face more here in the land of the living; the dark and ſilent Grave hath incloſed, and ſhut him in; and that he ſhould be ſnatched away ſo ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtily, and at a time when I could ſo ill have par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with him, is not this ſad? Do I not well if not to be angry, yet to grieve to purpoſe? Is not this a ſufficient Apology for me, was my Heart more imbittered with grief by many degrees then it is; let me here a little expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the caſe with my ſelf: And I muſt needs ſay this, that fretful Anger and immoderate Grief, are each of them both highly ſinful and unreaſonable; I beg, nay I command a true and ſober <hi>Anſwer</hi> to theſe few Queries; hath not the Lord indulged me with him a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable time, and that ſince I was in a capacity to have improved him? Methinks ſo many years Mercy of this Nature ſhould ſeem ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to me, who would now be ſo glad of one Day; have I not had many and many an opportunity of geting good by him, which I have careleſly let ſlip? Such a time he was preaching to me, and ſuch a time he was pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with me, and many a time he hath been privately at work for my good, reproving, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orting, directing and comforting me, both by
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:45231:54"/>word of mouth and writing; how fain would he have had me been ſome body for a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an? But alaſs, <hi>I have not known the day of my viſitation! O that I had been wiſe in time!</hi> I may well give my ſelf leave to grieve for my folly here in bitterneſs of Spirit: And farther, had I not good reaſon to expect, and a fair time of warning to prepare for that which is now come upon me? The comman fate of Mankind, more by far dying before his Age then exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, ſhould not this have put me in mind of his approaching change? <hi>Again,</hi> the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Body, the many Diſtempers that have been almoſt continually preying upon him, was not this a fair item? Hath not his Body for ſeveral Years, been like a poor old, crazy building, that muſt be underpropt again and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, to keep it from falling in? How many ſupporters that poor tottering Cottage of his hath continually required, to make it a tollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble dwelling for his Soul? Is it not a wonder, that ſo tender, neat and delicate an inhabitant hath not forſaken it before now? Many a time he hath been at the Graves mouth, and ſeemed to have as good as one Foot in, when yet the Lord hath ſaid return; and ſhall I yet have a face to ſay, he was ſnatched away haſtily (as if the Lord had taken me at an advantage) and urge this as an excuſe for my Impatience? This is ſhameful Impudence indeed: And far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, how many plain hints I have had from his own Mouth? How oft hath he been drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words of that nature, leſt after all when the time of his departure came I ſhould be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized, and ſo taken unprovided? So that its evident the Lord hath been no way a-wanting
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:45231:55"/>to me here; and let me have a care how I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon his Wiſdom, in the ordering of this ſad Providence, as to the circumſtance of time; He doth all things well, and in their proper Seaſon: To prepoſterate and act diſorderly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to ſuch as I, but is below a Being ſo infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely Perfect as God's is; ſpeak out, is it a fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thing that I ſhould be his Counceller? That my Folly ſhould correct his infinite Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom! Look back to hints of this nature given under the 5th Head, and if they be not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, thou ſhalt have another Lecture and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther after that, till thou be forced to yield up the cauſe, for God will, he muſt and ſhall have the day; and now ſeeing my Afflictions is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſingular for its alleviating then aggravating Circumſtances, let it be my great care and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, that my Carriage and Behaviour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, be ſingularly Pious and Exemplary.</p>
               <p n="10">
                  <hi>10thly.</hi> My time here is likely to be very ſhort, with which all my Troubles and Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings will expire; if I be one to whom the Lord hath graciouſly forgiven the everlaſting Puniſhment, a truly regenerate, ſanctified Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, intereſted in the righteouſneſs and ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Jeſus Chriſt (as I hope I am), I may then eaſily ſee to an end of theſe temporal Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, Death will put a final Period to them all; and why ſhould theſe things grieve me much, which ſhall not grieve me long? The length and continuance of any Affliction, or Calamity doth hughly aggravate it: This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration doth moſt amaze and torment the Damned, when they think on their intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, inſupportable Miſeries as endleſs; was but that one word <hi>[everlaſting]</hi> out of their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:45231:55"/>though it was inconceiveably ſad to be ſeparated from God the fountain of bliſs, and caſt into the lake which burns with fire and brimſtone though but for a ſhort term, yet me-thinks it was not one half ſo terrifying; the hopes of approaching eaſe and reſt, will make a Man go through preſent pain and labour with Patience; in the midſt of my troubled thoughts within me, when I am poreing upon my Croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Afflictions here, let me think with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſneſs and delight how ſhort lived both they and I am like to be, and of thoſe pure and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal joy's that will abide me; I muſt expect a multitude of Calamities conſtantly to attend me here, Sin and Suffering being ſo linked to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; it is a wonder of God's mercy that I am not afflicted only, and oppreſſed always! While I Sin I muſt expect to ſmart for it; if I reckon otherwiſe its fond and groundleſs, flat, contrary to what God in his Word, and in the conſtant methods of his Providence teacheth; what can the iſſue then be, but my moſt ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Diſappointment? Let me not therefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe my ſelf eaſe and reſt and quiet here, as if this was <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> when alaſs it is the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; Yet for my comfort this, though the day's of my life here are evil, full of trouble, yet they are but few: What is my life but a vapor, which appeareth for a little time and then paſſeth away? My day's upon earth are a ſhadow, they are ſwifter then a Poſt, they fly away, they are ſpent as a tale that is told; what are a thouſand Years to the eternal God, who knows neither beginning nor end of Day's? Alaſs they are as nothing! And what are they to future Eternity? A very ſmall, inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:45231:56"/>thing; then why ſhould ſhort momentary Afflictions, make ſo deep an impreſſion upon an immortal Spirit, that hath endleſs Felicity in its eye? Should not the lively Contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of thoſe eternal Joy's, reſerved for me in Heaven even ſwallow me up, and make me as it were forget my preſent Miſeries? Though for the preſent I am confin'd to this poor Cottage, and kept in hold in this dark, ſinful, dirty World, and am put upon many inconveniencies, and endure many hardſhips here: Yet I may look up and ſee a glorious Manſion prepared for me, and be ſurveying a very large and fair Eſtate indeed, Heaven a glorious Kingdom, which the Lord hath made over to me by deed of gift, ſealed and ratified in his Son's blood, which I am at preſent Heir to (through the abundant riches of his Grace,) and ſhall be put into full poſſeſſion of when once I come at Age; here is ſomething for my thoughts to work upon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed! A large and pleaſant Field to walk in by holy Meditation; had I never ſo much time, was I as well acquainted with this ſpiritual Art as ever Saint on earth was, and ſhould I ſpend never ſo many thoughts upon this moſt delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Subject, and make uſe of the greateſt helps that earth affords, yet I ſhould never be able to reckon up my ſpiritual Riches here, able either to conceive or expreſs what the Sum of all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to; all this World is not ſufficient to contain it! I am not able to imagine, what happineſs Angels and Saints enjoy in one ſingle hours Communion with God and Jeſus Chriſt in Heaven; O then what will Eternity be! Bleſſed eternity! Here I am quite loſt; how comes it to paſs, that I can ſo eaſily forget ſuch
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:45231:56"/>things as theſe? How ſad and ſhameful a thing it is, that I ſhould have a Heart, and find time and leiſure to think of almoſt any thing elſe, but not of God and Chriſt and Heaven? And why is my Heart no more filled with heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Joy in ſuch divine Contemplations? Doth Earth out-ballance Heaven? Light momentary Afflictions, weigh down the crown of Life and Glory? Surely no; let it then be ſo ſeen in my looks, carriage and behaviour; let it appear, that I have other manner of Thoughts of future, inviſible, eternal Things than the Men of the World have, that <hi>I</hi> do indeed look upon them as the greateſt Realities, and am ſuitably affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted towards them; let it now be manifeſted to the World, that <hi>I</hi> do practically believe the indubitable Certainty and unparalel'd Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Saint's happineſs in the life to come; <hi>I</hi> ſhould live with as much ſeriouſneſs to day, as though I was to die to morrow: And why then may I not be as cheary to day, as though <hi>I</hi> was to go to Heaven to morrow, not knowing but <hi>I</hi> may? And what a pleaſant Life might <hi>I</hi> thus lead, let my outward Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in the World be what they will! <hi>I</hi> ſay, could <hi>I</hi> but live from day to day in the believe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing views of near approaching Glory, what a comfortable Life might <hi>I</hi> lead! Why is it not thus with me? Where doth the hinderance lie? Is there any defect in the Object? No, no, its in my ſight; its a carnal, unbelieving, a ſloathful and negligent Heart that hinders me; away with ſuch a Heart! And farther, let me think how great a part of my evil Day's are certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly already ſpent; now above twenty Years are gone, and for ought <hi>I</hi> know a twentieth Part
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:45231:57"/>doth not remain; Faith and Patience lengthen out a while; <hi>I</hi> cannot have long to ſuffer here, it may be not near ſo long as <hi>I</hi> think of; a few day's more and the Tables are turned, the Scene quite alter'd; let me lift up my Head and hold up my Heart under preſent Preſſures, for the time of my full and compleat Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion draws nigh; my Salvation is nearer then when <hi>I</hi> firſt believed, and every day its draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on; <hi>yet a little while,</hi> and he that ſhall come will come, and will not tarry any longer; its but waiting a while and <hi>I</hi> am with him the loſs of whom <hi>I</hi> am now lamenting, in the new <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> the City of our God, where ſorrow and ſighing flee away, where God is all and in all to his Saints: To conclude, the time is ſhort, therefore let me weep as though <hi>I</hi> wept not; let me have Life with all its Troubles in quiet, enduring Patience, and Death with its bliſsful Conſequents, in lively Hope and earneſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire.</p>

                  <head>The PREFACE to his CATA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LOGUE of ſome of his dear Chriſtian Friends and Relations, whoſe Souls are now with GOD.</head>
                  <p>METHINKS the ſenſible decays I have found of late are a fair Item, that Death is not only upon its way towards me, but that it may be nearer in its approaches then poſſibly I am aware of, and ſo a loud call to me, in good earnest to be thinking of it, and of that eternal State I must im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately thereupon be fixed in.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes I cannot but verily hope, that the Lord hath cut me out for Heaven (though there is not, nor ever was there a wretch upon the Face of God's Earth that leſs deſerved it, nor can I think there is a Saint in Heaven that will have more reaſon amazingly to adore ſuch rich, free, diſtinguiſhing Grace and Mercy then my ſelf.) But yet though I have this Hope, that when Death turns me out of this World, I have a better Place to go to, and though I can thereupon ſometimes rejoyce and pleaſe my Self with the thoughts of its Approach, while I look upon it at ſome diſtance, yet when I come nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer to it, I find my thoughts and apprehenſions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it, and concerning the ſeparate State of my Soul thereupon, to have much ſtrangneſs and terrour in them, which its like doth much ariſe from my Ignorance and Unbelief.</p>
                  <p>I ſhould account it a bleſſed thing, could I but get to converſe with theſe things in my Thoughts with that familiarity and delight as I wiſh; and there
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:45231:58"/>is one thing I have ſometimes found a little to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friend me herein, which is to think how many of my dear Chriſtian Friends, with whom I have here had delightful Converſe and Communion, to think I ſay, how many of theſe are gone before me, and ſo ready to bid me welcome to that our bleſſed home.</p>
                  <p>Indeed was they not with my deareſt Lord, this Argument would looſe its Force; Heaven was not Heaven, was he not there; O let me live with Chriſt, let me ever behold the King in his Beauty; O let me but have my fill of Christ, and then I am content to ſpend my Eternity any where, was it in a Deſert, in a Denn.</p>
                  <p>But yet there is methinks ſome additional ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in it, to think of enjoying Christ in the Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip and Communion of the bleſſed ones above; and under the preſent, low and languiſhing Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Faith and other Graces in my Soul, it hath methinks ſome particular ſweetneſs in it, to think of my old Acquaintance who are got to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
                  <p>I intend therefore to have in my view a <hi>Catalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue</hi> of ſome of them as they come to my Thoughts, that ſo I may now and then make them a Viſit, and take a few turns with them in my ſerious Thoughts, and this in order to the End above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> Ten Q<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ERIES ſeriouſly Propounded to CARD-GAMESTERS: By one who much Queſtioneth the Lawfulneſs of that GAME.</head>
               <head type="sub">Introduction.</head>
               <p>I Doubt not but ſome Recreation is lawful, yea needful; and therefore a Duty to ſome Men: But among things that go under this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination, there are ſome utterly unlawful in their own Nature, and others which may be lawful in Themſelves, are by the abuſe of them rendred ſinful, or at beſt very doubtful; among many other Games and Sports in common Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice amongſt us, I fear upon ſerious Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, this of Card's will be found extream Faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; I ſhall give you ſome of my Thoughts, by Propounding the following <hi>Queries</hi> to you, hoping I may do it inoffenſively; and if I may prevail with you ſo far, as to be at the Pains to Read, and entertain a few ſober Thoughts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them, I ſhall leave it to your Selves to draw up a Concluſion, and paſs Sentence accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Merit of the Cauſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Query.</hi> 1. Is it not unlawful, or highly to be ſuſpected as ſuch, to uſe Lots in ſo vain and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial a Matter as Gameing is? You will readily grant me this, that it is a Sin of no ſmall Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to take God's ſacred Name in Vain; I mean, to do it needleſly, or but upon weighty Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.7. You cannot deny but God's
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:45231:59"/>name is uſed in Lots, Prov. 16. 33. <hi>The diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the Lot is of the Lord.</hi> Not of Man, or of Fortune; it is an appealing to God's Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence; and that this Game do much depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Lottery (if Perſons play honeſtly,) is a thing notoriouſly Evident; I deny not, but Lot's have been, and may be lawfully uſed in ſome Caſes: we We read of Divine Lot's which have been uſed upon a ſpecial Command, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 7.14, 15. <hi>Acts</hi> 1.24, 26. There are alſo civil and political Lot's, uſed in dividing Land's, deciding Controverſies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſee <hi>Acts</hi> 13.19. <hi>Neh.</hi> 11.1. And this is a proper means to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, or put an end to Contention, when Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons reſt ſatisfied in God's Determination, Prov. 18.18. <hi>The lot cauſeth contention to ceaſe;</hi> To ſay nothing of magical Lot's, which are certainly unlawful; our Queſtion is about looſory Lot's uſed in Games, and ſuch a one it is, as I think muſt be carried in the Negative: That is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you may lawfully appeal to the ſpecial Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God to determine, whether your Game ſhall go for or againſt you; hath this no appearance of Evil in it? Is it not a thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, by the ſame Law which condemns vain Oath's? Some think it is ſo, whoſe Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments you and I ought to Reverence; but ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it ſhould not be a taking God's Name in Vain (which yet I ſee no reaſon to grant,) I would enquire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 2. Can you ſeriouſly and heartily Pray to God, to bleſs your Card's to you? Do you, or dare you uſe any ejaculatory Prayer to God upon this Account, at your enterance upon, or in your Game? On the contrary, have you not ſome ſecret miſgivings in your Mind's, as
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:45231:59"/>to God's Approbation of it? Which brings to my Thoughts a Story I have read of a Poor Man, who had ſtolen a Calf for the Neceſſity of his Family; He got part of it prepared for eating: But when he came to crave God's bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing on it (as his uſe was), his Conſcience ſmote him ſo that he could not do it. Sure I am, there is no lawful Recreation, but one may warrantably and comfortably beg God's bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing upon it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 3. Doth this Game diſpoſe and fit you for the better diſcharge of your Duty? The moſt innocent and harmleſs Recreation is ſinful to me, if I uſe it meerly to delight and gratify my carnal Fancy. Without doubt, duty is the end of Recreation; well, I will ſuppoſe you to intend a right End; I ask now, have you found this to be a proper Means for the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it? Or, on the contrary, doth not manifold and ſad Experience tell you, that it hath much indiſpoſed you for any holy, religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Exerciſe, as Prayer, Meditation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And hath it not ſometimes unfitted you, for the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of your particular Callings?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 4. Is it not a great Time waſter? You know Time is a very precious thing; we muſt do great Matters in Time, or we are undon for ever; and we have but a very little of it; only this little inch in preſent Poſſeſſion is our's, and that flies away from us too; while I am writing and you are reading, it is marching a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with winged ſpeed, to the great Creator of all things, to declare what uſage it had with us: Now you know, when we have but a little of any thing of great Worth and Uſe to us, we take it very ill to be robbed of it; then why
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:45231:60"/>are we not more concerned about our Time, which is more precious then Gold? Now how many Hour's this Thief hath robbed you of? More then all the World could purchaſe for you, was it at your command; it ſhould be a ſad Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection to you and me, that we ſhould have ſo ſtrangly ſquandered away ſo much of our Time, which can never be recalled; and now for our future Benefit, let us ſoberly debate the Caſe with our Selves, whether the great Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of our Souls, in order to another Life, doth not call for all the Time we can well ſpare from our neceſſary Employments here: And will you, the next time you are tempted to ſpend it at Card's, but ask Conſcience this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, is time of no more worth to me, who may be ſo near to Eternity, and muſt give ſo ſtrict an Account of my Hour's?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 5. Is not this Game made the Exerciſe of Covetouſneſs? Do you not play with a deſign, and deſire of gaining that from your Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, which you give him nothing for? Is not this couching? And what think you by that?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 6. Is it not an occaſion of much idle, fooliſh Talk, of whole cluſters of words about every Caſt, and every Card almoſt? And doth it not frequently excite your Paſſions, and create unhappy Quarrels and Differences? I join theſe two together, becauſe generally they are one at the heels of another; now what ſay you to this? What think you of idle Words, and ſinful Paſſions; muſt we not give an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for theſe things? Objection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But here you will (its like) be ready to object and ſay, you go all this while upon a miſtake; we look upon it, and uſe it as a
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:45231:60"/>lawful Recreation; we do not ſpend ſo much time in it as you think of; and we play only for a Glaſs of Ale, which we are as willing to looſe as win: And we are not for quarelling.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If it be indeed ſo as you ſay, I am glad of it, and ſo far you deſerve Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation in it; if you can clear your Selves from what I have been hinting at, I fear there are but few Gameſters that are your Fellows: But granting this, I have one Queſtion in this Caſe to ask; that is,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> Whether thoſe you play with, be not guilty of ſome (if not of many) of thoſe things, which makes the Game unlawful to them? Whether they may not juſtly be charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Covetouſneſs, ſinful Pleaſure or Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And if ſo, whether you can clear your Selves, while you take part with, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them by your Example?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> Are we bound to keep all other Men from ſinning?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, you are bound to do your beſt towards it, and to take great heed that you no way contribute to their Sin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But here you may farther object and ſay, muſt we forbear every thing that another will make an occaſion of his Sin? At this rate, we muſt neglect a great part of our Duty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> To this I anſwer, though you may not neglect a Duty, to prevent anothers being ſcandalized or tempted to Sin; yet ſure you may omit an idle Sport, and an unneceſſary Paſtime: You may gueſs what the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi>'s Judgment would have been in this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.13. If he would forbear eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fleſh ſo long as he lived, rather then cauſe
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:45231:61"/>his Brother to offend: Should not your Sports be ſubject to the like Charity?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 7. Who are they that are fondeſt of, and moſt adicted to this Game? Are they not gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, the prophaneſt Sort of Men, or the looſer Sort of Profeſſors? Are not the moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, ſtrict and heavenly Chriſtians generally very ſuſpicious of, and much weaned from it? I deny not, but there may be ſerious Chriſtians that uſe this Game; ſome that I have known, and do know: But how do they uſe it? Not at the ordinary rate ſure; if they do, they are equally, yea in ſome Senſe more culpable than others; and I would farther enquire here, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the greater part of judicious and pious Miniſters and Chriſtians be not againſt it? <hi>I</hi> am perſwaded upon Examination, it would be found ſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 8. Can it be any good Sign, if you can recreate your Selves with that which is ſo great a grief and burthen to your Miniſters, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of your fellow Chriſtians, becauſe they look upon it as ſinful? O! How tender ſhould we be, in this Point? How fearful ſhould we be of grieving or offending any of our Brethren, for whom Chriſt died? He is very tender of them, and ſo much the more, as he ſeeth them tender of his Honour, and grieved and offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at Sin, whether in themſelves or others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 9. Tell me truly, how doth your Card's reliſh with you, when you are in the moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Frame? When you find the great things of another World impreſſed upon your Spirits, in the moſt freſh and lively Manner? <hi>I</hi> verily think if <hi>I</hi> ſhould fall to Card's, one ſerious Thought of Death and Judgment, one ſober
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:45231:61"/>Glance at my eternalState, would ſpoile my Sport; how is it with you in this Matter? If you muſt needs play on, will you make trial the next time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 10. To add no more; whether will the remembrance of ſo many Hours ſpent at Card's, be pleaſing or tormenting to you, when you come to die? And whether will it be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable or a ſad hearing from your Judge, when you come to give up your Accounts; we muſt account as ſtrictly for our Time, as for any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Talent we are entruſted with; and the Day which God hath prefixed, for this ſolemn and weighty Affair is drawing nigh; Death may be upon us, before we are aware; and when we ſhall ſee our ſelves ready to be arreſted, and ſummoned to appear without delay, before God's great Tribunal: Then (if ever) Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience will be reflecting upon our State and Actions; and when it ſhall find ſo much preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Time, at beſt but loſt and trifled away, which ſhould have been ſpent in glorifying God, and working out our own Salvation, what chideing Language may we expect to hear from it? I am ready to tremble ſometimes, when I think what my own Conſcience may have upon this Score, then to charge me with! Alaſs, poor Creatures! We make a ſhift to ſtop its Mouth now, or to ſtop our Ears: But if the Lord awake it then, it will ſpeak, and ſo loud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as ſhall make us hear, whether we will or no; O Fool's, or ſomewhat worſe that we are, thus to lay in for our own tormenting Grief and Sorrow! Now ſhall we not be wiſer for the future, and live more like to dying Men? O that we could bring our Hearts to this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we venture upon any thing, to think ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:45231:62"/>with our Selves, will this be comfortable to me at the reckoning? Shall I like to hear of this another day from my own Conſcience, or from the ſupream Judge of quick and dead?</p>
               <p>Now if there be any ſenſe or weight in the Queſtions I have here Propounded, I hope you will not think it an unreaſonable Requeſt, if I again earneſtly entreat for your ſerious Thoughts about them: And that you would not proceed farther, till you can anſwer them to God and your own Conſciences; one thing more, with which I conclude.</p>
               <p>You cannot deny but it is doubtful and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable, whether this Game be lawful or no: Whereas I dare affirm, and could (if need was) ſufficiently prove on the other hand, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt it may lawfully be forborn; and this is a good Rule for your Obſervation here, <hi>In dubiis opportet ſequi partem tatiorem.</hi> In doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Caſes we muſt take that way which is ſafeſt.</p>
               <p>Since the writing of this, <hi>I</hi> am ſatisfied that a Lot may be lawfully uſed in Games, as well as in any other ordinary Affair; and that your extraordinary Lot cannot be lawfully uſed in any Caſe how weighty ſoever, except Perſons have a divine Warrant for it: But though <hi>I</hi> ſee, and am ready to acknowledge my miſtake in this Point, yet am <hi>I</hi> of the ſame Mind <hi>I</hi> was before in reference to my own Practice here; and <hi>I</hi> could heartily wiſh that all Profeſſors eſpecially, would be very wary how they med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with a Game ſo ordinarily abuſed, and that is ſo full of Snares and Temptations, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out extraordinary Caution, they may as eaſily touch Pitch and not be defiled, as make uſe of it, and not be ſome way or other inſnared by it.</p>

                  <salute>Dear Cozen,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I Have been much concerned for you in my Thoughts ſince <hi>I</hi> ſaw you laſt; <hi>I</hi> would be one of thoſe that weep with them that weep, and remember thoſe that are in Adverſity, as being my ſelf alſo in the Body; and God forbid that <hi>I</hi> ſhould not tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Pity, and earneſtly Pray for you in this your afflicted Condition; though <hi>I</hi> have cauſe ſadly to bewail it, that there is ſo much of wretched Self in me, which goes ſo far with me, that while <hi>I</hi> am at eaſe, <hi>I</hi> am little affected with the Hardſhips others undergo, which plainly ſhews how far <hi>I</hi> am from the Life of holy Love: There is a ſaying of wiſe King <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 27.9. <hi>Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart; ſo doth the ſweetneſs of a Man's friend by hearty coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel:</hi> O that <hi>I</hi> was in a capacity, and had ability according to my hearty Deſire, to write or ſpeak any thing which might tend to your Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, Support and Comfort; O what pains ſhould <hi>I</hi> think too great (keeping within the limits of my calling,) to be laid out any way to
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:45231:63"/>promote the good of any poor Soul, which my Lord and Saviour did ſo eſteem as to think it worth dying for! And ſeeing you have been pleaſed in a great meaſure to open your Caſe to me (whom you ſhall ever find very faithful,) <hi>I</hi> will humbly adventure (though <hi>I</hi> am very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of my own Inability to do it effectually, and verily <hi>I</hi> think <hi>I</hi> have more need to come to you to learn, as multitudes of Years encreaſe Wiſdom and Experience,) yet <hi>I</hi> ſhall give you my poor, confuſed Thoughts what we ſhould learn from, and how we ought to carry under afflictive Providences; and <hi>I</hi> hope you will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of my ſincere Deſires, though <hi>I</hi> fall very ſhort in Performance, in the day of Adverſity conſider. A day of Affliction, ought to be a day of great Thoughtfulneſs with us; conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God doth not Afflict us willingly, without there be great need for it, and he hath wiſe and gracious End's in what he doth; <hi>His Rod when ever laid upon our backs hath a loud voice in it;</hi> O that we had diligent and tractable Hearts, in hearkening to and obeying it: Learning ſome ſpiritual Leſſons from every the leaſt twig there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of! O what abundance of ſpiritual Good might we thus extract out of our greateſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils! And what a multitude of Strokes might we thus prevent? And that you and <hi>I</hi> may be ſo wiſe, let us put the following Particulars into practice. <hi>1ſt.</hi> See we more and more of the evil of Sin, and hate and mortify it; Sin is the greateſt Evil, and the procuring Cauſe of all thoſe penal Evils which God inflicts upon us: Righteouſneſs and Judgment is ever to be aſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to our God, and all the blame to be charged home upon our own naughty Hearts; it is Sin
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:45231:63"/>which imbitters all our Comforts here; O hate Sin, and take a holy revenge upon it; <hi>Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are but the effect, Sin is the cauſe; now remove the Cauſe and the Effects will ceaſe:</hi> O what bruitiſh and unreaſonable Creatures are we, who are ſo much in love with Sin, a thing ſo odious and hateful in the ſight of God, and ſo miſchievous to our Selves? O unnatural we, who are ſo in love with our own Miſeries? Now that you may follow this Direction effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually, it would be a good way ſeriouſly to endeavour to find out what thoſe Sins are, that have had the greateſt hand in bringing this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction upon you; for in many of God's ſtrokes, his Hand his Rod points very viſibly to the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, <hi>I</hi> have verily thought ſo in ſeveral of the light Afflictions he hath laid upon me: When God afflicts us in Relations, we ought with ſhame and grief to reflect upon our relative Sins; <hi>I</hi> dare not but humbly mind you of this thing; having found out the <hi>Achans,</hi> let us diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch them without delay; let us humble our Souls exceedingly for them, and earneſtly beg the Pardon of them, and with all our might ſtrive againſt them: O let us ſhew Sin no mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy! Let the Lord ſee that his quarrelling with us, hath broached an irreconcilable quarrel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween our Souls and Sin. <hi>2dly.</hi> Let us be led to ſee more of the emptineſs and vanity of the Creature; ſince our fall from God to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, we are very prone to place and ſeek our Happineſs in it, whereas our Happineſs conſiſts, and ought to be placed in God alone who is the chief Good; and our Gracious God many times ſees good to Afflict his Children, moſt in thoſe things which have got the greateſt ſhare of their
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:45231:64"/>Affections, and ſo are likely to draw away moſt of their Hearts from him: O remember <hi>(dear Cozen)</hi> our Head and Husband the Lord Jeſus, hath a very jealous Eye over our deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Hearts, he cannot brook any adultrous Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections in his Spouſe; when he ſeeth we are following ſtrangers, and ſo growing ſtrange with him, it much offends him; yet ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant is his Love to us, that he takes various Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods to recover our Affections, and if nothing elſe will do it, rather then quite looſe us, he will hedge up our way with Thorns, and ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom that our naughty Hearts will be reclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed till it comes to that; I remember an Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of my Father, in a Sermon of his to this Purpoſe, I am verily perſwaded (ſaith he) that moſt of the laſhes laid upon God's Children here, are to pay home and ſharply to correct them for ſome overloving of the Creature: As I ſaid before, hate Sin more, ſo here love the World leſs. <hi>3dly.</hi> When ever we find the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil tempting us to hard Thoughts of God, then let us ſtand up and plead mightily for God's goodneſs; let not our baſe, diſtruſtful, unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Hearts, be ſuffered to entertain any ſuch vile Suggeſtions; when God's providences are dark and afflictive towards his People, then it is the Devils trick to do what he can to poſſeſs their Minds with black and unworthy Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of him, as if he had an evil Eye upon them, and grudged them their outward Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, or did willingly Afflict them, or took pleaſure in their Grief; ſo it is ſometimes with God's Church in general: <hi>Sion</hi>'s Language ſometimes is <hi>[The Lord hath forſaken, my God hath forgotten me.]</hi> And ſo it is frequently
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:45231:64"/>with particular Souls under their particular Tryals and Troubles here: How have poor I experienced this ſad Truth? And with what ſhame and ſorrow may I acknowledge the too great readineſs of my baſe Heart, to cloſe with ſuch Temptations? And if you do not meet with the ſame ſometimes, I can aſſure you from ſad Experience, your Caſe is ſingularly Happy; and if you do meet with them with abhorrence, reject and caſt them out; fear, yet ſcorn to entertain them; labour to recollect former Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences you have had of the Lord's loving kindneſs; <hi>He is unchangable in his Love to his:</hi> Think often what an Expreſſion it is of his Love and Care, that he will be at the pains to Afflict you; clearing your Adoption, you may thence eaſily argue that all your Afflictions are but Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly Chaſtizements: And O how would that ſweet Promiſe of God's turning all to our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Good and Advantage, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. if fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, ſeriouſly and believingly conſidered of, make us think very well of all he doth? <hi>4thly.</hi> Live by Faith upon the Attributes and Promiſes of God; it is nothing below this, that will be able to keep up your Heart and hold up your Head above theſe Waters; and here I would adviſe you, to ſeek out thoſe Attributes of God that moſt ſuit your Caſe; as it may be ſometimes you are puzzeled even at your Wit's end, and know not what to do, not what Courſe to take; I believe it is ſo with you ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, is it not? Your way is made dark in this Wilderneſs; why then have recourſe by Faith to the infinite Wiſdom of God; it may be you meet with a great deal of treachery and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs in the Creature; in this Caſe, live upon
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:45231:65"/>the Truth and Faithfulneſs of God which never fails: It may be, you may meet with cruel and harſh Uſage from ſuch, as you have no reaſon to expect moſt of the Contrary; in this Caſe, ſolace your Soul in the Conſideration of thoſe Bowels of Compaſſions, that are in your heavenly Father; and ſo improve all the Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of God, for they are all yours, and ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly engaged for you, if you be his; and ſo as to the Promiſes of God, ſeek out thoſe that come neareſt to your Caſe; promiſes of Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port under your Affliction, and of Deliverance when the Lord ſhall ſee that good for you, at leaſt of a bleſſed Sanctification of all to your Soul, which is ten Thouſand times better then preſent deliverance without it. <hi>5thly.</hi> The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of Patience is another thing, wherein a Chriſtian Carriage under Affliction doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt; a quiet ſubmitting unto, and acquieſſing in the good Will of God; conſider God's diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing Will in his Providence, is as really his Will, and doth as firmly conſtitute our Duty to Obey, as his commanding Will in his Word: And ſeeing it is his Will, that it ſhould be ſo with you as now it is, endeavour chearfully to ſubſcribe unto it; let it appear, that you are a Practitioner, yea a good Proficient in the holy Apoſtles Art, who had learnt in whatſoever State he was, therewith to be Content; what a poor Contentment is ours, if it depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Creature enjoyments, yet, what abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant reaſon we ſhould be Content with what we have, we deſerve nothing, ſo ſurely ought to be Content with any thing; and if an ever Bleſſed God will not Content us, ſurely we are very unreaſonable and fooliſh: And as for
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:45231:65"/>Patience, O what an unreaſonable thing is a fretting, murmuring, impatient Carriage in a Creature, and much more in a Child, under the righteous, wiſe and gracious Diſpoſals of God's Providence; it is eſpecially unreaſonable and ſinful in ſuch, who may ſee not only God's Hand, but alſo his Heart in their Afflictions; therefore in our Patience let us poſſeſs our Souls; let us conſider our Afflictions are but the juſt procurement of our Sin, and light in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of what we deſerve, and they are but ſhort, for a moment, and ſuch as we have need of, and God hath gracious End's in them, and will bring our good out of them; a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Deſign (I verily believe) he is now carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on upon your Soul, which could not have been ſo well effected another way: And in Heaven all our ſad day's will be forgotten, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo far, as they will adminiſter Occaſion for God's eternal Praiſes. <hi>6thly.</hi> Let us labour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a joyful, thankful Frame; what abundant Cauſe there is, that we ſhould not only be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, but in joyful Tribulation; let it be our care to clear up our Intereſt in God, and then let us take a ſurvey of the Heritage of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the many glorious Priviledges the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace entitles us unto, and then let us live up to our Means; poor, honeſt Hearts are frequently to blame here, in living below their Eſtates; alaſs, we place ſo much of our Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in the Creature, that much of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort depends upon it, but thus it ſhould not be; if God be our Portion, let us live upon him; let the World ſee, that however ſome cry down a Religious Life, as a ſad melancholy Life, and however others exalt their own Fancies, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:45231:66"/>and groſs Deluſions above it, yet let it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that we find that ſolid ground of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in it, as can bear up our Hearts under our greateſt Preſſures; <hi>dear Cozen,</hi> how unlike are we unto, and how unfit for the bleſſed Society of Angels and Saints above, who are continual<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly ſinging forth the high Praiſes of our God? Yea, how unlike we are to thoſe we here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs our ſelves to be? Is not Praiſe ever comely for the upright? O what a diſhonour we are to God and Religion, when every petty Croſs in the Creature can ſadden and ſink our Hearts, whilſt we have the God of all Conſolation to live upon? O what ſtrangers we are to our own Happineſs, in being ſuch ſtrangers to a Life of joyful Praiſe? O what merry Chriſtians might we be even under our ſaddeſt Circumſtances, were we but duly ſenſible of our highly privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged Eſtate even here? Lord vouchſafe unto us the joy of thy Salvation! Finally be inſtant in Prayer; I bring this in laſt, becauſe nothing I have ſaid will be of uſe to us without ſome Divine Influences be fetched in this way; O be frequent and earneſt with God in Prayer, that he would by his Spirit teach you what is the errand of this ſad Providence; that he would help you by your Affliction, to ſee more of the Evil of Sin, and more of the Vanity of the Creature, and help you under it, to keep up high, honourable and good Thoughts of himſelf, and that he would help you to act Faith, and exerciſe Patience, yea, and to live in his joyful Praiſes; And here I would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe you my hand, the beſt of my aſſiſtance I can give you; that little Intereſt I have at the Throne of Grace ſhall be employed for you:
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:45231:66"/>Thus I have given you ſome of my Thoughts; excuſe my boldneſs herein, I hope you will; I would have ſpent ſome Thoughts upon the particular Nature of your Affliction, and ſo of your particular Duties and Supports, but that I am deeply ſenſible of my own unfitneſs, and conſider what able experienced Miniſters and Chriſtians, you may have opportunity to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with; I muſt break of, being ſenſible my Pen hath been quite too nimble for me, I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been much more tedious then I firſt intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: <hi>Dear Cozen,</hi> I commend you to God and the Word of his Grace: This poor confuſed piece of Nonſenſe, the Lord was pleaſed to Bleſs; O what a workman is he?

               <p>I Receiv'd Your's, but am diſpleaſed with the Term you give my Letter; if you have got any Good, give God all the Glory to whom its due; and for a requital, help poor me with your Prayers; but I muſt earneſtly entreat you, to be ever very Cautious how you mention a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing that may be an incentive to Pride; you would not think what a ſmall Spark ſets this baſe Heart of mine on Fire: O my Pride, my Pride! Yea, I am afraid leaſt there ſhould be ſomething of it, in what I now write: O la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable Caſe! O abominable Sin! And it is eſpecially intollerable in me; you know this Sin is moſt odious and unaccountable in Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars, and therefore in my poor, beggarly Soul: <hi>Dear S.</hi> I could tell you a long and ſad Story, of a poor young Man under twenty Years of Age, who finds the old Man the body of Sin exceeding ſtrong, who many Years ſince did lamentably Experience the ſad Fruits and Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of original Corruption, and that fears that to this day, his Luſts gather ſtrength on him, inſtead of his geting ground on them; finding that his natural, ſinning Principles are not idle, but ever active, and finding farther, that his frequent Acts of Sin have greatly encreaſed and ſtrengthned the habit, ſo that now his Luſts do lord and domineer it over him at ſuch a ſtrange rate, that he is ready to fear ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:45231:68"/>that in the end his Iniquities will be his Ruin, that he ſhall one day fall by the hands of his Luſts, which are got to ſuch a head now, that they value not his Prayers, or any other Means that he can uſe againſt them of a Ruſh: Do you not pity ſuch a One? Methinks, I ſee you ready to weep over Him, and engraving his Condition upon your Heart, that ſo you may ever remember him when you go before the Lord; why to deal plainly with you I am he; and do not entertain ſuch a fooliſh Thought, as if I ſpoke worſe of my ſelf then I deſerve; indeed I do not know how to do that; I do not fear wronging this naughty, ſinful Heart and Nature of mine: <hi>O what a mirror of Sin and Impiety I am!</hi> Yet, who in my Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſo ſenſleſs? Indeed I have a Hankerchief lying by me, but God knows I have little need of, or uſe for it, and much more may I ſay, my dear Saviour hath full little need of one for my Heart; though he be willing and ready, yet I do not give him occaſion for the Execution of his Office, who is the binder up of broken Hearts; but Lord, who is it that can break my Heart but thee! O firſt wound and then heal! I bleſs thee, for that little, ſmall degree of Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibleneſs thou haſt given me, O encreaſe it! But yet Lord, how long ſhall this be the beſt Chear I have to weep and mourn over my head ſtrong Luſts? When wilt thou by thy Omnipotent Grace, help me down with them? When ſhall a day of triumph come? Dear Lord, after thou haſt got the Victory, wilt thou ſuffer theſe thy Enemies to come and ſpoile thee, of thy conqueſt in my Soul?

               <p>I Receiv'd your refreſhing Letter, and bleſſed be God-that I did ſo, for verily it put a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Life and Comfort into my Soul; I hope you will excuſe the rudeneſs of any Expreſſion in my laſt, and I return you thanks for your good
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:45231:69"/>Councel, not to deny the Grace of God; O I would not do ſo; indeed, ſometimes poor Soul, have ſuch bleared Eyes with Sorrow for Sin; that they are prone to overlook God's Graces O that I may never be guilty of ſuch Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude! But no great danger of it upon this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count while my Heart is ſo hard; O for more Humiliation, and more Sorrow! Alaſs! I am not one of thoſe weepers, that take on ſo for Sin; its true <hi>I</hi> am apt enough to overlook God's Grace, but its from another a contrary Cauſe: <hi>Dear</hi> S. my Condition is really the ſame as <hi>I</hi> hinted to you, and much worſe: You may make your own to be ſomewhat like it; bleſs God that gives you to think low of your Self: Well <hi>I</hi> would ſay ſomething to the Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of us both; be it granted that our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is ſuch and ſuch, yet (as you ſay,) there is Merit and Satisfaction enough in Chriſt, and there is Mercy and Pity enough in him, and in his Father through him, for the worſt of us, even my ſelf; our Corruptions are ſtrong: What then! Are they too ſtrong for his Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent Grace? O no, they cannot ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it; believe me <hi>Siſter,</hi> though we be weak in our ſelves, yet we have mighty ſtrong Friends; God and Jeſus Chriſt, and the holy Spirit of Grace are on our ſides; What then, ſhall we be afraid and utterly dejected at the Thoughts of our Enemies? O no, for ſhame; they be more that are with us, then they that are againſt us; God is my Covenant engaged to carry on the Work that he hath begun: think often of that ſweet Place that hath oft revived me <hi>[I will not break the bruiſed reed.—]</hi> He will not do it himſelf, nor ſuffer any elſe to
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:45231:69"/>do it; yet how hard it is to believe ſuch things, to believe them ſoundly <hi>I</hi> ſay, when we are under our diſcouragements? Well, let us walk humbly, but no longer ſadly and diſconſolately; it pleaſeth the Devil, when he ſeeth his Deſign take ſo well with us as it doth, when he can deprive us of Peace and Comfort; but our ſad diſconſolate Looks are no Satisfaction or Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to our gracious Father; He is no farther pleaſed with our Sorrow, then as it prepares us for the diſcharge of higher Duties, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of higher Graces; he had rather ſee our Souls elevated in the higheſt ſtrains of Love, Joy and Praiſe; well, ſtudy we now in every thing to pleaſe him; and that which is our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in this as well as in all other things, would be our great Priviledge; I was troubled to hear that ſhe whom I lov'd was Sick, but glad to hear you are better; my Prayer for you is, that all things may work together for your Good; your Mercies and your Afflictions I look upon as my own: The Lord bleſs you with Pardon, Grace and Peace!

<pb n="130" facs="tcp:45231:70"/>would be grieved when any Blaſpheme that worthy Name, but methinks it ſounds ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like Heaven, when any are celebrating the Praiſes of the Lamb; indeed I have both ſeen and heard that of him lately, that would not have left me ſo Tongue ty'd in this Matter as I am, was not my Heart ſo bad as it is; O the Love of Chriſt, methinks it ſhould be the burthèn of all our Songs; methinks <hi>I</hi> would fain be ſaying ſomething, I know not how to cull out a more excellent Heart, affecting Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to write to you on; but I am afraid to meddle almoſt, becauſe my low and ill Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement will be but a diſparagement of his matchleſs Love: O that I knew but what to think or write that might affect my own Heart and Your's! But what a ſtrange Heart have I to deal with? What can affect me if this do not? O thou Stone, or harder if harder can be! May your Heart be more affected in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding then mine is in writing, and when it is ſo, O then remember poor me; O how ſhould our Hearts be affected when we conſider the Perſon loving, the Manner how he hath loved us, the rich Benefits his Love hath put him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, procuring for us, or we our ſelves the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons beloved! <hi>That he the only begotten Son of God,</hi> who was his Father's delight from all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, ever rejoycing in his Preſence, that he ſhould have ſuch a gracious Reſpect to us, ſuch poor, ſorry, contemptible vile and ſinful Wretches as we are; that he ſhould Love us, and that at ſuch a rate as he hath done, even to die for us, and this when he knew before hand how diſingeniouſly we ſhould carry it towards him, even returning him Hatred for his Love;
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:45231:70"/>O this is the moſt prodigious, ſtupendious Act of condeſending Love imaginable! And then, O think, his Love is eternal Love; though he was not actually our Saviour from Eternity, yet he was ſo appointed in God's eternal Purpoſe and Decree; O that the ever bleſſed God ſhould have ſuch eternal projects of Love, for ſuch worms as we! And his Love is to Eternity, for whom he thus loves once, he loves to the end; and ſhould not this ſtir our Hearts if we have any Life in us, to think that the Son of God ſhould have ſuch a ſpecial Eye upon us, in his Death procuring the effectual Application of that Redemption he was then working out to our Souls, in whom there was nothing antecedently to move him to ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing Love? O what ſhall we think of thoſe invaluable Benefits he hath procured for us, as reconciliation, juſtification, ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and eternal Glory? O that I could get my Heart more affected with this aſtoniſhing Love! Lord I cannot comprehend, <hi>I</hi> cannot reach it; no wonder it paſſeth Knowledge, its Love in a Myſtery, but I do and will admire it, and look and long for a ſight of thee in Heaven, where <hi>I</hi> ſhall know thee better, with all the Heart af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting Circumſtances of thy Love, being ever under the warm and melting Influences there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: <hi>Hath Christ ſo loved us,</hi> what follows but that we hate Sin more, and love the World leſs, but Him more, and expreſs our love in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the things he commands us, and in a willingneſs and readineſs to deny our Selves, in any thing dear to us for his Sake; well, I hope you will pick ſomething out of theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed

O <hi>how ſhould we love him our Head, and one another as fellow members of his body?

We ſhould not be quite diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged as though our caſe was ſingular?

But all our work lieth not in complaining, but we muſt uſe the means God hath appointed for our quickning; I veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:45231:72"/>believe our greateſt work lieth, in prevailing with our own Hearts, to the diligent, conſtant, and believing uſe of the means; certainly quickning enlivening Grace is purchaſed for us by the Lord Jeſus; and now he hath gone through the moſt painful part of his Work, is he not willing to apply to our Souls what he hath purchaſed? O let us not once queſtion this? O let us not wrong a dear Redeemer ſo much as to think otherwiſe of him! O me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks was I but once made a meet recipient of theſe influences of his Spirit, I ſhould not doubt but I ſhould have them! Well, it is Grace that muſt make us ſo, and we have a gracious God to deal with, who delights in Communicating of his grace and goodneſs to his Creatures; let us call to mind what we heard of this Subject, when we was laſt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; let us ply our Hearts with the ſerious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the Sin and Evil of ſuch a Frame, together with the neceſſity, reaſonableneſs, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency and uſefulneſs of the Contrary; let us pray hard for it and uſe other means: But pray <hi>S.</hi> take heed of that ungrateful Partiality, as to judge and conclude from the remainders of Sin in you, that you are in a ſtate of Sin and Death; the beſt on Earth complain of dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and they do not Complement, but have real Cauſe for it; a perfect freedom from all Sin and its Effects, remember that is reſerved for Heaven: Have you not a principle of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual life?

Methinks if I was with you, and you would be faithful to your ſelf, <hi>I</hi> ſhould not doubt but <hi>I</hi> could convince you; think as ill of Sin as you will, as you can, but
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:45231:73"/>acknowledge and honour Grace; joyfully and thankfully entertain any quickning Motions you have, as you would have more; what I ſay to you, I would ſpeak home to my own Soul, the Lord help me that I may!

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:45231:73"/>
                  <hi>I</hi> love in my Heart to read and hear and think of Death my ſelf; indeed <hi>I</hi> have now out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lived my ſelf, my own expectation ſome Years: But O the unaccountable folly that <hi>I</hi> am guilty of in that <hi>I</hi> am yet no more fit to die! O ſtrange almoſt incredible! <hi>I</hi> Profeſs to believe a Future Judgment, that there is a day wherein the great God by Jeſus Chriſt will Judge me with all the World, for all my Thoughts and Words and Actions, whether they have been good or bad, and ſo ſentence me to my final State: But O how unaffecting are my Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of this certain, great and dreadful Truth, and how inconſiſtent is my Practice to the belief hereof! <hi>I</hi> am daily running on in my Errors, heaping one Sin upon the back of another, ſo laying my ſelf under an unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able neceſſity either of bitter Repentance here, or elſe expoſing my ſelf to the condemning Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of a moſt juſt and righteous Judge here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, to a State of inconceivable and endleſs Miſery, which is enough to make any Heart except ſuch a Flint as mine, to tremble if ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly thought of: Well, ſhall <hi>I</hi> go on in this careleſs Frame and Courſe? <hi>I</hi> fear, <hi>I</hi> fear <hi>I</hi> ſhall, but God forbid! Well, there are two things <hi>I</hi> would commend to my ſelf and you, in order to our Preparation for Death and Judgment. <hi>1ſt.</hi> Let us make ſure of a true and thorough work of Sanctification upon our Hearts; O how ſhall we dare to look Death in the Face, if found in an unſanctified Eſtate? <hi>Sin is the sting of Death;</hi> but then how may we with undant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Courage look it in the Face, and as it were play with it when the Sting is taken out, when we are paſſed from Death to Life; if Sin be
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:45231:74"/>dead to be ſure its pardoned; ſo otherwiſe, how ſhall we think of Judgment, to which Death immediately carries our Souls? Will God clear the Guilty? The turning point at that Day will be, whether we be ſuch as have come up to the Terms required of us in the remedying Law of Grace; all are Sinners that is certain, but all are not impenitent, unbelieving Sinners; O <hi>Siſter,</hi> penitent, believing, holy Souls, and they alone ſhall be able to ſtand in Judgment; ſhall obtain Mercy from the Lord in that Day, and none but ſuch have real ground of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in the forethoughts of it. <hi>2dly.</hi> Let us la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour after clear and certain Evidences, of our ſincerity; O how ſweet a thing is Aſſurance of God's Love, peace of Conſcience, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt? How would theſe chear and revive our Souls in a dying Hour? Sure <hi>I</hi> am, a well grounded Aſſurance would then pay us our own with Intereſt, though we ſhould be at never ſo much pains to attain it; but how ſad to be ſent to bed in the Dark; it muſt needs be very uncomfortable to a gracious Soul, to leave this World uncertain how it ſhall go with it in the next; therefore let us ſtudy the Word more, which is the Rule by which we muſt be judged, and impartially compare our Hearts and Lives therewith, by which means through God's help we may come to know how it will go with us then: Bleſſed be God for that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of his Will!

I talk of Heaven! Of an Eternity to be ſpent in the love and joyful Praiſes of God, and a dear Redeemer! Truly it is a ſhame while my Heart is ſo backward to, and unskilful in this bleſſed Work; O had Heaven no better ſingers then I am, or am like to make, what poor harmony, what harſh melody would there be among them? But for the eternal Praiſe of the great <hi>Jehovah</hi> it ſhall not be thus; many times when I hear the pretty Bird's ſinging forth his Praiſes in their kind, I am aſhamed of my ſelf; I am generally ſecure and ſenſeleſs, ſometimes ſad, but ſeldom joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. <hi>1ſt.</hi> Oh, how ſecure and dead I am; many times I have ſcarce any Senſe, or feeling of Spiritual things upon my Heart; I have ſuch a ſenſeleſs, benumed Conſcience, through Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom in Sin, that I feel little of the weight and burthen of it, or of my need of a Saviour; alaſs, while others are joyfully praſing God and a dear Redeemer; I have need to pray for a

Or, elſe I am ready to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, but it is more rarely thus with me, I moſtly err on the other hand.

               <p>I Receiv'd your's and return you thanks for it, and for your (I do not doubt) hearty Prayer for me, for ſpiritual Joy; but O that you would help me to pray more Sorrow into
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:45231:75"/>my Heart firſt; you tell me I know, <hi>what they ſhall reap that ſow in tears,</hi> to wit Joy: But if that be Scripture as I know it is, I may expect but a ſmall Crop; not that I think my Tears can waſh away the Guilt of the leaſt Sin, or merit the leaſt favourable Glance of God's Countenance; but Repentance, of which Godly ſorrow is one part, is a neceſſary Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification; O therefore pray for more of that and herein you will exceedingly befriend me; I am afraid you are exceedingly miſtaken in me; I do not wiſh you ſo ill as you wiſh your ſelf, to be in my State and Frame: Sure I am, if you did believe the Diſcription I have given you of it (which I do again own and acknowledge to be worſe then I did, or can diſcribe to you) you would not wiſh ſo; however if I do think worſe of my ſelf then I ſhould, which yet I am confident I do not, yet ſure I am, you err more on the other hand, in thinking better of me then I deſerve; and be not troubled at my Complaints: O will you not give me leave to Complain? Was I under any outward Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble I am ſure you would, and that you would gladly endeavour to help me too; and will you not give me leave to Complain of my Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al wants and burthens?

               <p>YOUR Soul is very precious in my ſight; my hearty deſire and prayer for you is that you may be ſaved; and O that I could do any thing to promote it; it pleaſes me much to think in how hopeful a way you are for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and O how I ſhould rejoyce to ſee you crowned there; but alaſs, we are yet but in the Fight with our Enemies; yet faint not, hold on and the day is our own, conquer and we are crowned; yet be we jealous of our ſelves, I am ready to tremble when I think of our danger by our Enemy the World; it is a very Cheat, and how ready we are to be impoſed upon by it? For my own part, I never thought there had been ſo much Carnality in my Heart, as I lately diſcovered; and O I am afraid there is much more abominable wickedneſs that I
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:45231:78"/>have not yet diſcovered! O methinks I would have ſomething beſides God for my Portion, I am loath to caſt all my worldly hopes over board; O my Folly! Well, my love to you inclines me to impart ſome of my Thoughts to you in this Matter: God and the World are preſented to our Choice, and this is our chooſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing time, now that you and I may make a wiſe Choice. <hi>1ſt.</hi> Let us ſeriouſly conſider the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of God; O happy Souls indeed whoſe Portion the Lord is! O wonderful, wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful! That the ever bleſſed God ſhould be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to become the Creatures portion, a portion for ſuch Wretches as we are! Let all the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Saints of God, admire and adore him for this his matchlefs Condeſcention and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Bounty! Now think what God is, and can we not be content with him for a Portion? What not with God? Why what is there that our Souls can reaſonably deſire, that is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minently in him? O there is enough in God to make us compleatly and eternally Happy, and what would we have more? <hi>2dly,</hi> Think we ſeriouſly of the Vanity of the Creature; O what trifles are theſe that Men make ſuch a hurry about? Such as are projecting moſt throngly for the World, alaſs, what have they when they have got it but a little Vanity, for which they many time looſe an eternal Crown; O woful Choice? When ſuch come to die, they will put another eſtimate upon the World; I dare appeal to your own Experience, when you have any ſerious thoughts of Death and Judgment and the Life to come, then O how little you regard the World? I find it thus with me; now let us learn this project to ſet one
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:45231:79"/>Enemy againſt another, to ſet Death againſt the World; as one ſaith frequentiy lie down in our own Graves, and thence take a proſpect of the World; let us take our Coffin into the Field with us when we go to fight the World: And farther to make us ſerious, let us conſider it is for everlaſting that we chooſe here; chooſe God in Chriſt for our portion and he is our own for ever; chooſe Sin and the World and we looſe him, and Hell muſt be our portion, and our loſs herein will be everlaſtingly impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; the Lord help us to act like reaſonable Creatures; but I muſt take leave; if I have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny intereſt in you, I would entitle a dear Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer to it; Will you chooſe him? I hope you have; but will you renew and confirm your choice, and never reſt till you can; <hi>my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved is mine, and I am his;</hi> I am one that would fain be your Companion in the path of Holineſs here, and joint Poſſeſſor with you of Happineſs hereafter.</p>

               <p>I Received your's, and the doubt which trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles you, I find to be the ſame that I have been exerciſed with my ſelf, ſo I ſhall give you a few of my Thoughts, although I am under diſcouragements, and have much ado to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade my Pen to write, when I think I have
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:45231:79"/>more need to ſeek advice then to give in this Caſe; ſo ſar as I underſtand it, the matter ſtands thus with us, we fear we are not ſick enough for Chriſt to heal, we are not humbled enough, our hearts not broken enough for Chriſt to bind them up; now its true thoſe are deceitful flatterers that would teach us to ſlight Humiliation for Sin, this is a dangerous deceit, they will prove but unſound believers that were never ſoundly humbled; but we muſt conſider all Chriſt's Patients are not ſick to the like de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree: The wounds of ſuch are not all of a like depth; ſome the Spirit deals more gently and tenderly with, draws them with the cords of love, when others he ſnatcheth as brands out of the Fire; if the Lord hath done his Work, ſhall we peeviſhly quarrel with him becauſe he hath not done it juſt as we deſire? O let the Lord take his own method, ſo he will but ſave our Souls from Sin and Wrath! But its well if there be not Pride in the bottom, when we are ſo thoughtful about theſe preparatory Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; we would fain bring ſomething to Chriſt that might make us more acceptable; O de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful Hearts, wicked Hearts! As one ſaith, why do we not complain more of our want of Faith? Theſe preparatory Works are of no worth, but as they are means to promote a ſaving cloſure with Chriſt; our buſineſs is to enquire whether our Humiliation for Sin hath attain'd its end; and that Humiliation is ſufficient as to its End, which prevails ſo far as that we cannot reſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied without Chriſt, when the Soul is ſo ſick that it cannot but cry out give me Chriſt or I die; either we ſee our need of him or not; if not, why then do we complain of our ſelves as
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:45231:80"/>loſt without him? Either we are willing to be ſaved by him in his own way or not; if we are, it is a great diſhonour and wrong to him to doubt of his Willingneſs; <hi>He is more willing to ſave us, then we are to be ſaved by him;</hi> when you object your want of Tears, that you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not mourn for Sin, I can tell you a ſadder Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which makes me write with wet Eyes, I ſay, I have more reaſon to complain of hypocritical Tears, then you have for the want of them; Humiliation and Repentance lieth chiefly in your Will: I remember a ſaying of Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s, there is more Humiliation (ſaith he) in a baſe eſteem of ones ſelf, then in a thouſand Tears, more of it in a will and deſire to Weep, then in the greateſt abundance of Tears that come either from the force of Terrour, or from the moiſtneſs of the Brain; could I ſind more of this inward Soul humiliation, I could take abundantly more comfort in that, then in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of Tears, while my Heart is thus Senſeleſs and feels little; when you ſpeak of Reformation; conſider the terms of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, Sincerity is accepted inſtead of ſinleſs Perfection; and our dear Redeemer ſees not only what his Servants are, but what they ſhould be, and what they ſhall be: O happy time when we ſhall all ſee him as he is, and be like him! I take little notice of what you ſay of that Expreſſion in my laſt; I am ſtill rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ſay as much, ſubſcribing my ſelf a Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar in the loweſt Form in the School of the Lord Jeſus.</p>

What Comfort may be ſafely drawn from ſuch Premiſes? As to what you ſay, that you fear its only a good Mood that you are in; it muſt be granted that natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral unregenerate Perſons have their good Moods ſometimes, but I think they never come in them to a ſincere willingneſs and reſolution, to cloſe with a Goſpel Chriſt on Goſpel Terms; they may have ſome faint Wiſhes and Deſires, but the Mood is off them before any change is wrought upon their Hearts and Wills, and when it leaves them they are more hardened and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure then before; and while they are in ſuch a Frame they are out of their Element, like Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes in the Air; but I am confidently perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that you find it otherwiſe with your ſelf, when you find your Heart in a holy good Frame, you are where you would be, and when you find it otherwiſe, it is your grief and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then; O how glad you would be, was there no ſuch ſad and ſinful interruptions in your Communion with God and a dear Redeemer? Such a happineſs as this, is well worth dying
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:45231:81"/>for; and why ſhould you be diſcouraged at that which is the common Caſe of all God's Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren upon Earth?

               <p>I Cannot but really ſympathize with you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your preſent Troubles; methinks I feel part of the burthen that lieth upon you, O that I could do any thing to make it more eaſy and light to you! But alaſs I can do little more then pray for you; well, as your Troubles abound, ſo may your Graces and Comforts abound much more! May your Soul proſper indeed! May all your outward Troubles prove ſpiritually Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious! If ſo, I both may and will rejoyce in your Happineſs; I take it for a certain Truth, that it goeth well or ill with us as Matters go with our Souls; alaſs, what are thoſe Mercies worth that do not ſomeway reach our Souls? And why ſhould we not prize thoſe Afflictions that further their Salvation, and love that God the better that ſends them? Sure I am, theſe ſick Souls of our's need Phyſick as well as Food,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:45231:82"/>and why ſhould we not bleſs God for the one as well as for the other, when both tend to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote our ſpiritual Health? O that we were brought to kiſs the Rod, patiently, chearfully and thankfully to ſubmit to the Lord's ſevereſt Diſcipline, who intends us good and not hurt, and will iſſue all things well! Dear <hi>M.</hi> chear up as well as you can; labour to get above this lower Region; O what ſolid Comforts may be fetched from Heaven in our darkeſt Hours here! O how great, how ſure, how near is our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward there! <hi>Eye hath not ſeen, nor Ear heard, nor hath it entered into the Heart of Man to conceive what God hath laid up for them that love him;</hi> and all this (we none of us know how much,) as ſure as the decree and promiſe of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and unchangeable God can make it; and near too; <hi>The Lord is at hand,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>behold I come quickly, and my reward is with me;</hi> dear <hi>M.</hi> Comfort your ſelf with theſe Words; be very careful of your ſelf, leaſt grief be added to our Affliction: My dear <hi>F.</hi> though I have not time to write, is much in my Thoughts; his illneſs hath damped my Spirit in that Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs you know of; many Friends are inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive about him, and I hope many Prayers are going up to Heaven for him here:</p>

               <p>HAVING a little time I reſolved to write a line or two, hoping they would not be unwelcome; I have little buſineſs except Soul concerns to write about, but indeed that is our greateſt Buſineſs, theſe our grand Concerns, and all other things even thoſe we call Matters of Weight, great Concerns, they are but tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles compared with theſe; it is a great Comfort to me when I think what comfortable Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces I hope I have of the good Eſtate of your Soul; I think my ſelf happy in having ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Relations related to Jeſus Chriſt; O happy Family, highly favoured of the Lord, that is likely to turn out ſo many Souls for Heaven! O <hi>S.</hi> make ſure to be one, and pray hard for me that I may be another, yea that there may not be one outcaſt amongſt us; and labour to get as long an Heaven as ever you can; O we may begin Heaven even here! O how much more of Heaven might me enjoy then we do? Well, I will tell you what I would be preſſing after, even to maintain a conſtant, ſtrict and holy Communion with God in and through Chriſt; O the ſweetneſs of Communion with God? Oh, our unſpeakable loſs in having Hearts ſo alienated from God, and in being ſuch ſtrangers to a heavenly Life? Lord, how long ſhall it be thus? How long e're we may love and enjoy thee perfectly, without the leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſion,

Well, it is our happineſs to deſire and long and wait with Patience for that, which others (happy they are) do poſſeſs and enjoy with fulleſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction; may our Souls now be following harder after God? May we now live like be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, a life of holy Love and joyful praiſes?

Yea, and I hope when a few Minutes of Time more are paſt, we ſhall be removed out of this Vale of Tears, and meet upon the Mountains of Spices; O a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py meeting that will be, will it not think you?

O what is this Heart of mine made of, that it is no more affected?

               <p>I Hope you will not take it ill that you have not heard from me before now; I am ſure you are much in my thoughts, and I ſhould be glad to exchange a Letter with you now and then; I had many affectionate concerned Thoughts about you when I heard of your late illneſs, and it was not a little Comfort to me when I heard of your recovery, much more ſhall the health and proſperity of your Soul rejoyce my Heart; and that it may be daily promoted by all the Methods of God's Providence, as well as by his Ordinances, is and ſhall be my daily Prayer to that God who I hope hath begun a good Work there: Dear <hi>S.</hi> the near Relation I am in to you, lays me under a ſtrong Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to do the utmoſt I am able to promote the welfare of your outward Man, but me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks I feel my Affections eſpecially working towards your Soul: Well, how is it? Is your Soul in health? Doth your Soul proſper? By nature our Souls are like Hoſpitals for ſpiritual Diſeaſes; O there is no ſound Part left in them; but the Lord out of his Divine pity and bounty, hath provided a wife, able and tender hearted Phyſician for us the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who hath prepared a rich Medicine every way ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to our Diſeaſes of his own moſt precious Blood; and he is daily begging for Patients, and his great Complaint is, that Men will not
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:45231:85"/>come to him, who would aſſuredly and freely heal them, but rather chooſe Death; now O that you and I may ſee more of our need of him; our Souls are really, O that they were more ſenſibly Sick, our Diſeaſes are in their own Nature mortal ones, and all others beſides him are Phyſicians of no value; but if he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake our Cure the danger is over, no fear of miſcarrying under his Hands; O that now we may be ſo thoroughly convinced of our need of him, and of his ability, skill and good will, that we may now look after him indeed, and no more neglect him as we have done, but may ſincerely, heartily, chearfully and thankfully accept him, and fiducially put our lives, our ſouls, our all into his Hands, confiding in him, and in him alone, and obedientially following his Preſcriptions, then our Souls ſhould live and not die; but I muſt take leave; let me hear how it is with you: You have a daily remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance in my poor Prayers,</p>

               <p>I Receiv'd your's which I took very kindly; I had thoughts of writing to you before I received it, for I ſhall be glad of intercourſe this way, and deſire it may be ſo managed, as that it may prove to the great Advantage of us both; we ſhould ever act like Perſons for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World, and ſhould endeavour to manage
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:45231:86"/>every thing ſo, as may help our ſelves and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers forward in our way to Heaven, O that we may; I have two things to adviſe you to, and let my Councel be acceptable; The <hi>First</hi> is, highly eſteem, and accordingly improve your precious Time; ſurely if we did but conſider how much great and neceſſary Work lies upon our hands, we could not ſo lightly eſteem and ſquan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der away that ſhort and precious Time allotted to us for the doing of it in; we have much to do for God to promote his Honour and Glory; much to do for our Selves, for our Souls; we have our Salvation to work out, an Intereſt in Chriſt to ſecure and clear, weak Graces to ſtrengthen, ſtrong Corruptions to ſubdue, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and ſtrong Temptations to reſiſt and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, many hard and difficult Duties to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, and we muſt expect that the task of Duties (though in another Senſe we ſhould not look upon Duty as a task) will be encreaſing as we grow up; and much we have to do for others to promote their good: We have our Generation to ſerve in the places God ſets us in, and all this muſt be done in time, and is not that Time to be accounted Precious? And far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it may be much ſhorter then we think of; what is Man's life taken at its full length? It is but as a Span; days and years paſs away like the Wind, are ſpent as a Tale that is told; but let not you and I promiſe our ſelves long Life, but be thinking of a ſhorter cut then ordinary to the Grave; I queſtion not but Death is trip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the Heels of ſome young Perſons about you in D. as well as here; let us take warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by them, and learn to prize and improve our precious Time; I could wiſh you knew
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:45231:86"/>what ſad Reflections I have upon my ſelf for the miſpent of time, that I ſhould have lived ſo long to ſo little Purpoſe: Now dear <hi>S.</hi> you have ſeveral of thoſe years before your Face (if the Lord lengthen out your Life) which alaſs are got behind my back, and cannot be recalled; O lay hold on this advantage, and cut off the occaſion of ſuch ſad Reflections now in time: My <hi>Second</hi> advice is, That you would keep up a conſtant Courſe of religious Duties, and labour in them for ſweet and ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Communion with God, I have ſuffered much by my neglect of Duties and by trifling in them; O the long and ſad interruptions of my Communion with God! O the ſad effects of this! Methinks ſloath, idleneſs and formality hath even cloathed my poor Soul with raggs; Take heed <hi>S.</hi> take heed: It can never be well with us when we are ſtrange with God, and live at a diſtance from him. To live without God in the World is an Hell upon Earth; O keep your Heart cloſe to God in a courſe of Holy Duties; be oft in God's walks, and be not contented unleſs you meet with him there; but alaſs while I am writing this, methinks Conſcience is whiſpering, thou doſt not follow this advice thy ſelf as thou ſhouldſt; I muſt confeſs this is a Truth, and a ſad one, but I think it is good Advice, and I would fain have it better with me then it hath been in theſe reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects, or then it may at preſent be with me, and beſides I would have you better, much better then my ſelf, therefore take and follow it; my daily Prayers are for you; the Lord be your God and Guide, and everlaſting Portion!</p>

               <p>I Have been deeply concerned for you for ſome time of late, upon the account of that exceſſive trouble and ſadneſs of Spirit, which hath ſo ſorely born you down of late; and as it is my Duty, ſo it would be greatly delightful to me, could I but do any thing to help you againſt that, which as it cannot but be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing unto God, ſo alſo very Afflictive to your ſelf, and to all that love and tender you; I was laſt week caſting in my Thoughts for ſome Cordial for you, and I hope the good Providence of God hath directed me to that, which I have here ſent you encloſed; the God of all comfort, bleſs and make it Effectual; it is that which I have ſometimes found a wonderful Virtue in my ſelf, and therefore I can the better recommend it to you; will you promiſe me to read it over, and not only now when you firſt receive it, but whenever you find a fainting fit of Sorrow coming upon you? Will you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe me to read it ſeriouſly and believingly ? Why then I dare give you leave to be ſad, and diſconſolate if you can; O that I knew but what argument to uſe with you or with God for you (for you are never out of my praying Thoughts,) I dare not be unfaithful to you; I muſt tell you plainly there is more Sin in it then you are aware of, and it is the cauſe of much Sin; I know it by too ſad experience my ſelf,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:45231:88"/>when I have ſometimes been in your Caſe, though then I could not ſee it, alaſs things were hidden from me; <hi>Again,</hi> your Sorrow makes the Devil Merry, O it pleaſeth him; he knows he cannot hurt you hereafter, it will be out of his Hands, therefore he takes delight in your diſquiet here; and I tell you (mark it, for its that I have experienced) every time you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge your ſelf in it, will he get the ſtronger hank upon you, which you will be leſs able to ſhake off: Herein you are very ingenious to your ſelf; you know not what inward Peace it deprives you of; it quenches the Spirit; then it greatly injures you as to your outward Man; and it is very Afflictive to all that love you; as for my own part, it clouds and daſheth all my outward Comfort when ever I think of you, and the Lord knows that is not ſeldom; and my poor <hi>F.</hi> is declining faſt, and your cheari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs I am well ſatisfied, would be better to him then any Phyſick: Well dear <hi>M.</hi> I am daily pleading with <hi>G.</hi> for you, as I have now been pleading with you; I ſhall now wait for my Anſwer from you both; may it be a comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble one?

               <p>I Was much concerned to ſee you ſo low when you was here in Town; I earneſtly beg the Lord would make your burthen lighter, and in the mean time encreaſe your Strength to bear it; and it would much rejoyce my Heart could I do any thing to help you either of theſe Ways; your Exerciſes are many and great, and you are one of a ſorrowful Spirit, whereby all your other burthens faſten themſelves the more and deeper upon you; I can ſay ſomething to your Caſe from my own Experience, being many times much troubled with the ſame Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper; I will therefore tell you how I find it with my ſelf, and what courſe I have found moſt helpful to me; I have my exerciſes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ways both inward and outward, and ſuch as are no ſmall ones, and when a melancholy Fit takes me, I am many times ready quite to ſink under them, and can do little elſe but ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate my Troubles, and make every little thing great, and inwardly laſh and torment my ſelf not only with what I at preſent feel, but alſo with future fears, being ready to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:45231:91"/>it will never be better, but worſe and worſe with me, a thouſand ſad perplexing Thoughts crowd into my Mind, and I pleaſe my ſelf in this tormenting of my ſelf, though when the fit is over I cannot but condemn my ſelf for it; yet while under it, I really think I cannot do otherwiſe, nay, that I do well in it; and then ſometimes I can neither read nor hear any thing, but I muſt meditate Terrour from it, and make nothing of bearing falſe witneſs againſt my ſelf, every thing muſt go againſt me be it right or wrong; at other times the beſt Friends I have can ſcarce ſay or do any thing to pleaſe me, but I can find ſomething to diſquiet both my ſelf and them, ſometimes I have gone alone to think it out, but I find there is no end of that; but now I will tell you of two things wherein I have found the moſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief; the one is ſecret Prayer; when I find one of theſe Fits is creeping on me, when I find my ſelf pinched or burthened one way or other, I then take the firſt opportunity I can poſſibly get to go alone, and there to give my Heart free vent, endeavouring to turn my Trouble into a right Channel, confeſſing and bewailing my Sins, and while I am thus endeavouring to lay this load on, my other burthens are removed before I am aware, and moreover its ten to one the Lord removes that burthen too before I have done; believe me, I have ſometimes gone to that Duty with as heavy an Heart as I think a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny poor Creature ever had, and have come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with it as light as though I had been in a corner of Heaven; I do not ſay this, as though I thought you a ſtranger to this ſweet remedy, but to put you in mind to take it ſeaſonably; do
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:45231:92"/>not defer it to your wonted times of Prayer, but take the very firſt opportunity that you can; ſometimes when I have thus deferred, my Heart hath been ſo ſtrangely bound up, that I could ſcarce pray at all; be ſure to obſerve this, to take the remedy in time before the Diſtemper hath got too much hold; I believe this which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows is a very needful piece of Advice to you (becauſe I know you have uſed much to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect your ſelf, and I am afraid you do ſo ſtill, whereby you injure your ſelf both Soul and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy more then you are aware); in this caſe uſe thoſe Creature comforts and ſupports the Lord affords you, not only as a thing Lawful but as your Duty; You aſſuredly Sin if you do not; I dare ſay it is the Lord's mind, that you ſhould not deny your ſelf any thing that might make you more chearful in his Service, and he hath ſo provided in his Providence, that you need not want any thing that tends to the ſupport or comfort of your Life, and then how dare you deny your ſelf? Dear <hi>M.</hi> I write not theſe things at random, for I know much of your Caſe by my own, and having tried theſe things I recommend them to you; now let my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel be acceptable to you, and that the Lord would make it effectual, my earneſt Prayers ſhall follow theſe poor Lines, and if I might un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand they are of Advantage to you, it would very much rejoyce my Heart even mine,</p>

But excuſe my boldneſs in menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning theſe things, for all Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, and the thing it Self, I wholly leave to the Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your much better Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: If you ſhould approve of it, and ſhould think a private way of engaging Perſons to it moſt Prudent, and have not a fitter Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ready, I ſhould be glad to take any pains to ſet the Matter on foot; I do not queſtion, but you will take the Matter into your Thoughts, ſo as that if you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it, another Week may not be loſt: And if I have your En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, I would make uſe of the little acquaintance and intereſt I have in ſeveral other Congregations both nearer and more remote, ſpeedily to engage them in the like courſe; I look upon my Seif as more ingaged then others to promote ſuch Work, becauſe I know I can do ſo little my Self; I beg a particular remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance in your Prayers, who alaſs am a very poor, ſinful, uſeleſs, good for notning, and ſo very needy though unworthy:</p>

               <p>UPON the receipt of a conſiderable ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Mercy the latter end of <hi>November</hi> laſt, as I was projecting what return to make, it pleaſed the Lord to direct my Thoughts and ſtrenuouſly to encline them to this, <hi>Scil.</hi> to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt the engaging of a weekly Hour of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, by Perſons apart in their Cloſets', as for the univerſal Church of God, and eſpecially that part of it amongſt us in theſe poor ſinful Lands, ſo particularly for this preſent Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and he hath been pleaſed to ſucceed my poor Endeavours herein, to the actual engaging of a great Number of excellent pious praying Miniſters and private Chriſtians, as in this, ſo likewiſe in divers neighbouring Countries, as <hi>Darbyſhire, Leiceſterſhire, Yorkſhire, Cheſhire</hi> and <hi>Lancaſhire;</hi> my poor Thoughts have again and again been looking towards <hi>London,</hi> where I know there are vaſt Numbers of ſuch as are Princes upon their Knees, but have had thoſe diſcouragements ariſing in, and from my Self, as have hitherto laid an embargo upon my Pen; indeed I was ready all along to fear (as I had juſt Reaſon,) that this Religious project would (if it took in the main, yet) ſuffer much da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage by its paſſing through my ſorry Hands; but meeting with unexpected Succeſs to my ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great ſurprizing Joy, I am now encouraged
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:45231:103"/>to hoiſt the Sails and make this further and higher Adventure (O that it may be as proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous, yea more abundantly ſo!) And I am the more encouraged, becauſe I have your dear Self, whoſe prudence, zeal and intereſt in the Hearts of others, I have ſuch a full ſatisfaction of to apply my ſelf unto: And now dear <hi>Sir,</hi> my humble and earneſt Requeſt is, That you will be pleaſe to take the firſt convenient Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity you have, to acquaint ſome of your Pious, publick ſpirited Miniſters with it, ſuch as have the greateſt Intereſt in, and Influence upon others, and endeavour to engage them to the like Undertaking, and to uſe their utmoſt Endeavour to engage the reſt of their reverend Brethren in and about the City, and each of them (in ſuch a way as their Prudence ſhall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect) to engage as many of their ſerious pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing People as poſſibly they can, that (as there is great need) there may be a confederate humble violence uſed, and as general an attack as may be made upon the Gates of Heaven; Our time is <hi>Tueſday</hi> Morning Seven a Clock as near as we can: Your Circumſtances in the City may much differ from our's in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and however I well not preſume to hint any thing by way of direction here, but give me leave to renew my humble earneſt Requeſt, that you would be pleaſe to Concur with us in the Thing, and then whether you ſhall pleaſe to take the Field before upon that, or on the preceding Day, or whether you pleaſe to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after with your Recruits to make a freſh and more vigorous Attack, if we have you but for our Confederates, we ſtill have our wiſh; indeed at firſt for ſome Reaſons, I thought it beſt
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:45231:103"/>to engage Perſons to continue this Courſe out only during this preſent Seſſion of Parliament, though I then had it in my Eye, and ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſhall (the Lord permitting and enabling me) actually endeavour the continuance of it longer; in ſhort <hi>Sir,</hi> either till Mercy comes, or a prohibition of Prayer (the latter of which the Lord grant never may! If it doth, then farewel all:) Methinks there is no way like it; but if it ſhall pleaſe the Lord further to ſmile upon me in inclining your Heart to undertake, and in ſucceeding you herein, you ſhall hear more of that; methinks there are many things which loudly beſpeak, and will ſufficiently warrant ſuch an Undertaking; our own Caſe as well as that of other poor Churches is very preſſing; verily <hi>Sir,</hi> our ordinary way of Praying will not do, will not paſs now; O that we could in good earneſt fall to wreſtling! Alaſs <hi>Sir,</hi> how the Credit of Prayer is fallen in the World of late! Our Enemies do not fear Prayers as they have done; and truly if my poor ſad Caſe be that of others of God's Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, I am afraid the reaſon is, that neither our Graces nor our Luſts ſeek our Prayers as they ſhould do, if they did, our Enemies would ſoon be taught to fear Prayer again; let us therefore ſtir up our ſelves and one another, and once more ſee what Prayer will do; would it but pleaſe the Lord to raiſe the old Spirit of Prayers in the Hearts of his People, and ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble them rightly to follow their Prayers in their Lives, might we not look upon this as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Preſage of ſome notable Appearance of his, for his Intereſt amongſt us! The holy fervent Prayers of his People formerly uſed to pass
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:45231:104"/>currant with him for a whole Kingdom; ſure we are reduced to ſore Extremities indeed, if our Prayers be ſo clipt (as our Coin) that the praying Soul can now only ſave One; but if I ſhould go about to uſe any Arguments with you in ſuch a buſineſs as this, I ſhould herein forget my ſelf, for I queſtion not, but you are, and will be more ready (then poor unworthy I) of you own accord; if any thing of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be done amongſt you, then take no notice of this poor Scrible; if not, I doubt not but you will ſpeedily and vigorouſly ſet your Self to the promoting of it, and the Lord be with you to direct, aſſiſt and ſucceed you! If you will pleaſe to conceal my Name in this Buſineſs (which can give no advantage to it) you will oblige me; I ſhall impatiently long for a few Lines from you about it, and ſurely good News would be to my Soul as cold Water to the Thirſty? But I have been over tedious and troubleſome, and may well reckon, that before this I have tired your Patience, and ſo muſt think of a cloſe; I earneſtly beg a particular Remembrance in your Prayers, who alaſs am ſtill a poor ſinful, needy, unworthy, uſeleſs, good for nothing; My humble Service to your good Lady:</p>

               <p>YOUR'S I receiv'd, which upon a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Account was very welcome to me; bleſſed be <hi>G.</hi> ſince my laſt, there is a comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble change in my Father (who preſents his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and Thanks to you) the laſt Lord's day he was enabled for his Work here amongſt us! I rejoyce in your ready compliance with my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer requeſt, which indeed I did not doubt of; what need there is of that Duty? O how ſoon may we have a loud providential Call to it! My Heart oft trembles within me, I cannot, I cannot but meditate Terrour, when I ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly think of poor <hi>England</hi>'s Caſe; is not the Lord very angry with us? Is he not e'en wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with forbearing? Is not wrath e'en ready to fall? I ſhould be glad if I was alone in theſe Apprehenſions, or, if I durſt look upon them in my ſelf and others, as the meer products of a melancholly Phancy; but alaſs its otherwiſe, therefore <hi>[let us Pray]</hi> dear <hi>Sir,</hi> ſpeed the thing all you can; O how ſoon it may (in ſome reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects) be too late! I hope ſome of us fin'd ſince this was ſet on foot amongſt us, ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving of a Spirit of Prayer, but our fears of impending Judgments not abated; but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, will it not be good for us that we be found preparing to meet our <hi>G.</hi> in the way of his Judgments, and framing to put our ſelves
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:45231:105"/>into the Gap? Will not this be more comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, then to be found among thoſe who are ſtill further making a way unto his Anger? Since my laſt, I found amongſt my Papers the <hi>Cities call to Prayer</hi> in 1693; would not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of that Nature be highly ſeaſonable now? But with humble Submiſſion I think and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deſire, that no time be limitted for the Contrivance of it; let us Pray and not faint; let us hold on until <hi>Salvation unto our God</hi> be our Song: But there ſhould be ſome alteration of the Hour in Summer; what if it be from ſix to ſeven in Summer, and from ſeven to eight in Winter; <hi>Monday</hi> Morning, doth not ſo well ſute us here in the Country, becauſe many of our Miniſters are forced to travel abroad to their Labours, and cannot be ſo free as at home; but pardon my boldneſs in hinting at theſe things; I leave it to your Prudence whether you will mention them or no; but dear <hi>Sir,</hi> ſpeed the Buſineſs all you can; I am the rather urgent with you here, becauſe I have engaged my Friends only during this preſent Seſſion of Parliament, which I preſume is not likely to be long, and methinks I would not have one praying Hour intermitted, and yet I am loath my Pen ſhould go the round a ſecond time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I have ſomthing from you; I beg you would be urgent with your worthy Miniſters for a ſecond Call to the whole Kingdom, which I ſhall in impatiently long for, not to eaſe my Pains, but to do the Work much more univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally and effectually; and to encourage them to it, let them know that the Iron is now hot with many of us; by the experiments I have made, I find a great readineſs of Mind to the
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:45231:105"/>Duty, and dare almoſt promiſe them a general univerſal Correſpondence with the thing, by thoſe whoſe Prayers are likely to ſtand poor <hi>England</hi> in any ſtead at this dark and trembling Point of Time, though it cannot be expected that all ſhould fall in exactly with every Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance; the good Lord give them an one-reſt of Heart in this Affair. and the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in complying with them!

               <p>I Cannot but eagerly take hold of the firſt Opportunity to let you know, how well I was pleaſed with the ſhort hint you gave me in the cloſe of your laſt; the Lord help me to do it ſo as may be to your eternal Advantage! Since you took the little good Advice I gave you, ſo well I am encouraged thereby to tell you more of my Heart. I do not diſſemble
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:45231:106"/>with you in telling you that yon have a great ſhare of my Affections; if you was my own Brother, I think I could not love you better; and I am well ſatisfied that (as we uſe to ſay) there is no love loſt between us, that you bear the like Affection unto me; now I would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to make the beſt improvement of the Intereſt I have in you, and ſurely that cannot be better done, then by doing my utmoſt to in-title my great Maſter a dear and lovely Jeſus to it; I do heartily rejoyce in your outward proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, but more earneſtly deſire the Proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of your Soul, and ſhould exceedingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, might <hi>I</hi> any way be an inſtrument in promoting it; the thing <hi>I</hi> aim at, is not ſo much the proſelyting you, the bringing you over to my way and party, but the engaging you in a courſe of ſerious Godlineſs; though as <hi>I</hi> have found <hi>G.</hi> in the way that <hi>I</hi> am in, <hi>I</hi> dare not forſake it my ſelf ſo far as <hi>I</hi> am ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it is according to his Word, yet <hi>I</hi> am far from thinking that Religion lies in Notions and Opinions, and <hi>I</hi> doubt not but that there are many ſerious Chriſtians that differ from me in their Opinions about leſſer Matters; but this, all ſerious Chriſtians in the World are agreed in that, without converſion, regeneration, true repentance, faith and real holineſs, both of Heart and Life, there is no hopes of Salvation. Now this is the Buſineſs you and <hi>I</hi> muſt look after, to ſee that we have paſt the new birth, are throughly changed from what we were by Nature; and truly Grace makes a mighty great Change where it comes; it is a thing above Morality, common Civillity, above a formal Profeſſion, above outward Attendance or Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:45231:106"/>above the common Works of the Spirit in the Hearts of Men; it is an inward deep, powerful abiding thing: The Lord give us to experience it, in and upon our own Souls, without which, its impoſſible that all the Words in the World ſhould make us rightly underſtand it. The poor miſerable deluded World, thinks all this is meer Phancy, but aſſure your ſelf its otherwiſe. I know you will meet with a great many Objections ariſing from Satan and your own Heart, as I and all others who have expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of a ſaving work of <hi>G.</hi> upon their Souls have done before you; He will its like endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to make you ſhy of Convictions of your ſin and miſery by Nature, which in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree or other ever goes before a ſound Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; but as you love your Soul, when ever you feel the holy Spirit of <hi>G.</hi> this way at work, do not ſtifle, but encourage them all you can; when you feel your ſelf pained this way, take the firſt opportunity you can to retire into ſome private Place, and there pour out your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint before the Lord, acknowledge your ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, lament your miſery, cry to him for Mercy, caſt your Soul at his Feet, and though you ſhould not have eaſe and ſatisfaction at firſt, yet be not diſcouraged, but hold on, ſeek him in good earneſt, and my Soul for your's he is found of you. And its like he will endeavour to prejudice you againſt Religion as too ſtrict, as a moroſs, dull, melancholy Thing, as that which would deprive you of all the Comfort of your Life; but this is notoriouſly Falſe. I would not delude you, and I do, and muſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly profeſs to you this, in juſt commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of my dear Maſter and his Service, that I
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:45231:107"/>am fully ſatisfied upon the little trial I have made, that a religious godly Life, is the moſt pleaſant Life in all the World again; Wiſdoms Ways, are ways of Pleaſantneſs, and all her paths are Peace; I have now been acquainted with Him and his Service many Years, and ſtill the more I know of Him and his Service, the better I am pleaſed with both, and that upon ſolid ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Grounds; really I ſpeak my very Heart to you in theſe things, and nothing but what you ſhall certainly find your Self, if you will but come and ſee, if you will but make trial as I have done. Indeed Religion doth forbid all beaſtly Pleaſures, but it doth not need them, for it brings others infinitely better in their room which are peculiar to it ſelf, which ſtrangers intermeddle not with; and then as to ſober manlike Pleaſures, its ſo far from depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of them, that it gives the beſt right unto the ſweeteſt Enjoyments, and the ſureſt hold of them; And the beſt is ſtill behind, even thoſe Rivers of Joys and Pleaſures at God's right Hand for ever more, where others muſt ly down in endleſs Sorrow; but I am afraid you will think me too tedious, do not take it ill from me, I verily think you will not; God is my witneſs, that love to my Maſter whom I can never admire, never commend, never ſave ſo much, or ſo well as he deſerves I ſhould, and love to your Soul, a longing deſire, that you two may come to be ſavingly acquainted together hath ſet my Pen on work, let him give it good ſpeed! I greatly delight in you here, but I would very fain take you along with me to Heaven; let us not part! But I dare not for a World delude and flatter you
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:45231:107"/>here, without a ſound Converſion, without true Faith in Chriſt and real Holineſs, this can never be. I am many times praying hard for you in my Cloſet when you little think of it: I earneſtly recommend to your ſerious Peruſal, that little Book I left for your good Wife when I was laſt with you, the Lord do you much by it!</p>

               <p>IT pleaſeth the Lord to make uſe of ſuch a ſorry unworthy Inſtrument as I, in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging of a great Number of Miniſters, and other ſerious praying Perſons in this and divers neighbouring Counties, to ſpend one Hour every Week in extraordinary ſeeking <hi>I.</hi> for his Ch. in general, and particularly for theſe poor ſinful tottering Kingdoms, and to continue this Courſe during the late Seſſions of Parliament, and meeting with very encouraging Succeſs in my poor Attempts here in the Country, and withal obſerving again and again in my Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſtill more then ordinary impreſſions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my Spirit of ſore Judgments near approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I was thus both excited and encouraged, to
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:45231:108"/>recommend the like Undertaking to a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Gentleman of my acquaintance in <hi>London,</hi> Dr. <hi>H.</hi> I wrote to him again and again about it, earneſtly preſſed him, if it might be to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure from you and neighbouring Miniſters, a printed Call to Prayer to the whole Kingdom. I had it in my Thoughts before the foreſaid time was out, to have written to my Friends here a ſecond time to engage the Continuance of this needful Work, but was in hopes that a printed Call from you might have been procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to do the Work every way much more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually, but I begin now to be diſcouraged, hearing nothing from my Friend about it; this hath occaſioned my taking the boldneſs to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble you with theſe Lines; I know your Hands are very full, yet I earneſtly beg you will take the firſt opportunity you can to ſpeak with the Dr. about it, to know what hath been done in it, and if nothing of this Nature may be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, then I beg a few Lines from you as ſoon as poſſible, that private endeavours may be uſed; alaſs <hi>Sir,</hi> which way can one look and not ſee a preſſing Call to this Duty? Indeed the Lord hath lately given us a great deliverance, but truly laying things together, for my part, I know not whether it hath more encreaſed my Hopes or Fears; ſuch a thing rightly improv'd would have been ſomething: But if after all God's goodneſs to us we continue as bad as ever, if not worſe, what may we expect then? If the Lord be forced after all to ſtrike, may we not fear the blow will fall very heavy? Indeed I fear a ſore Storm is haſting upon <hi>England,</hi> a Land reſolvedly bent upon its own Ruine. Doth not the Lord expect ſomething more then ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:45231:108"/>from us at ſuch a time as this? And if we generally flocked about him in good earneſt, who knows but he might yet be entreated? And however though the Storm ſhould not be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, yet would it not certainly be better for us, yea and for <hi>England</hi> too, that it find us on our Knees? Pray <hi>Sir,</hi> let me not be long with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a few Lines from you; methinks the Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs requires haſt:</p>

               <p>YOUR'S I received laſt Week very glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly notwithſtanding ſome miſtake; I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you thought my former Letter had come from my Father; I wonder much that my weakneſs did not ſoon make you ſenſible of your miſtake, but your Charity is ſuch as made you cover it; I am not ſorry upon ſome accounts, that you did ſo miſtake, though I thought it a point of Juſtice to him, to give you this hint of it: <hi>Sir,</hi> I heartily rejoyce and bleſs <hi>G.</hi> for what I underſtand by your's is already done, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther intended by you in <hi>London</hi> in way of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. If you have occaſion in a ſhort time to go near Dr. <hi>H.</hi> or elſe if you would pleaſe to ſend for him, he would fully acquaint you with my
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:45231:109"/>poor Thoughts about this Affair, what hath been done by us in this part of the Country during the late Seſſion of Parliament, and with what humble Submiſſion I earneſtly deſired might further be done: In ſhort I was think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that if you would pleaſe to fix upon a week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Hour of Prayer, and then ſend abroad if it was but one half Sheet to acquaint us with your Practice, and to excite us to fall in with it, it might do great ſervice by the ſucceſs I lately met with in theſe Parts, I am encouraged to hope that it would be very taking, and general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly complyed with, by all thoſe whoſe Prayers are likely to ſtand poor <hi>England</hi> in any ſtead at this needful time; I remember you did ſomething of this Nature in 93. A conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Number of Copies were providentially ſent to my Hand, which bleſſed be <hi>I.</hi> I ſpread with ſucceſs. But methinks the time ſhould not be prefixed in too ſhort limits as to Continuance; and ſo if upon conſulting with your Reverend Brethren, you ſhould think of doing any thing of this Nature, what if you put in for the continuance of it every Campain while the War laſts, and ſo as well every Seſſion of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament? Or indeed, why ſhould it not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued without any intermiſſion at all, even till Mercy comes, and ſo our Note be changed to that of Praiſe, only with ſome alteration of the Hour in Winter? Who knows what the damage may be if <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Hands fall down, though but for a while? Indeed ſuch a thing would make the buſineſs Publick, and to many its like would be too ready to make an ill Uſe of it; but truly <hi>Sir</hi> in my Opinion, this is not a time for us to ſtand upon ſuch Points; is not
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:45231:109"/>our warrant good, our call clear loud and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing! And if we follow our work to purpoſe, we need not be aſhamed to let the World know what we are about, nor need we fear but that our <hi>G.</hi> will yet again in due time own and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour Prayer, if it be but rightly managed and followed by us; but pardon my boldneſs in hint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at theſe things, and in detaining you ſo long; I ſhall thankfully receive your Notes about Prayer and help my Father to them; he lives in the Country, and though he did not know of my writing to you, yet I know his Thoughts concur with mine herein, and had he been with me now, I doubt not but he would have intimated ſo much with ſervice and thanks to you;</p>

               <p>YOU will underſtand by my former Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that your's came ſafe to hand, and was to the rejoycing of my Heart; bleſſed be
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:45231:110"/>
                  <hi>G.</hi> for the great ſatisfaction therein given of your ſenſe of matters of the higheſt Concern; <hi>I</hi> hope the Lord hath in ſome meaſure made you ſenſible of the worth of your Soul, of your Sin and Danger, of your need of Chriſt and Grace in order to eternal Life and Glory; and that he hath alſo enclined you ſeriouſly and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently without delay, to mind the things which concerns your everlaſting Peace; the good Lord keep this for ever in your imagination of the thought of your Heart; and eſtabliſh your Heart unto him. Indeed as you hint ſincerity and heartineſs in Religion is worth all; and meer pretences to it how fair and ſpecious ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, never did nor will ſave one Soul, but will aggravate the Condemnation of many; when others great care is to ſeem better then they are, the Lord help us that our's may be to be better then we ſeem, this is right in the ſight of the Lord! O that I could find more of this temper in this Soul of mine! As to that which you hint at, which hath been a great diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to you, the unſuitable Carriage of Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors. It is a common Caſe and a ſad one; wo to the World becauſe of ſuch Offences, and wo to thoſe by whom ſuch Offences come: It doth very much prejudice the World againſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Religion and Godlineſs, when they ſee ſuch as are high pretenders to it, can be as looſe as others; though indeed if you obſerve, you will find the World watcheth ſuch moſt critical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſpy any thing amiſs in them, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they do falſly accuſe, and at other times aggravate Matters at a high rate out of an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred (if the truth was known) of Religion and Godlineſs it ſelf; but alaſs its too true God knows,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:45231:111"/>that many that are high pretenders to theſe, are but meer pretenders, and no wonder if theſe miſcarry and become a reproach to Religion; and truly (though I do not think you aimed at me in it yet) <hi>I</hi> muſt acknowledge that in many things <hi>I</hi> act ſo unſutably to my Profeſſion, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times that <hi>I</hi> am e'en aſhamed the World ſhould know, who am I, for fear that bleſſed Name and Cauſe I bear and ſtand up for, ſhould ſuffer by me; but as to this, you have prevented me in ſaying, that in ſhort, that I ſhould have done, that this ſhould not hinder others and make them think worſe of Religion, its bleſſed Authors ways and end, but rather quicken them the more to ſee to ſoundneſs at the bottom, that they take up a Profeſſion on right Grounds, that they have a right Principle within, and make them more chearful after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to live up unto it, and back it with a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Practice: As to what you further hint a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Diſſenting Miniſters, if you heard them but ſpeak for themſelves, you would ſoon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that it was not a proud, ſturdy, refra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory Humour that made about two Thouſand of them wiſe, learned and pious Perſons at once quiet their Places, run the hazard of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, Baniſhment, and in all probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty the utter undoing of themſelves and families as to this World, and (which was yet dearer to them) deny themſelves the publick Advantage they had of doing good to Souls; but the truth is, ſuch things was impoſed on them, which how indifferent and lawful ſoever they appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to others, after the diligent uſe of the beſt means for Satisfaction did not appear ſo to them, which therefore they could not comply with,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:45231:111"/>without ſinning againſt God, and wounding their own Conſciences, which they durſt not deliberately and wittingly do, tho' it had been to ſave the World; and their Arguments are ſuch as their Oppoſers could never yet Anſwer ſatisfactorily in the Judgment of judicious im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Men; and ſober Conformiſts, though they are ſatisfied with the lawfulneſs of them, yet bear them as their Burthen, and ſome of them have pleaded the Nonconformiſts Cauſe: But as I do not much trouble my own Head, ſo neither would I trouble your's with matters of Controverſy, though if you deſire it, I will give you further ſatisfaction in this Point; for my own Part, I can freely join with the Church of <hi>England</hi> in their Worſhip (as our Miniſters frequently do) ſo far as I am not obliged to join in that which I look on as a Corruption in it, and where I can ſee any of them that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be ſincere, a truly God-fearing Man, I ſpeak my Heart, that Man I can put in my boſom as well as any of my own Party; we are both agreed in the main, and I believe we ſhall never be all of one Mind in every Point while in this imperfect State, where we cannot aſſent in Judgment, let us diſſent with Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; O that there was more of this Diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on both ſides! And that we could mutually ſtudy and endeavour to outſtrip one another in promoting the Common, but glorious Cauſe of Chriſt and Chriſtianity in the World, making Religion our Buſineſs, being careful to adorn our Profeſſion with ſutable Converſations; then I doubt not but we ſhall all meet in the ſame Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the end, and the glorious Light which then beams forth from the Father of Lights,

I am ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in pain about them, fearing leaſt the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary by ſtirring up a Spirit of Diviſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them ſhould much hinder the Work, we are not ignorant of his Devices, the good Lord rebuke him: I beſeech you <hi>Sir,</hi> remember them on that account, I ſhall do what I can to cut off all occaſion by procuring ſomething far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for Mr. <hi>P.</hi> to diſpoſe of as he pleaſeth; I am in hopes of ſomething out of my Lord <hi>Wharton</hi>'s Charity, but cannot yet get a poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Anſwer. I wonder ſometimes that the Lord ſhould encline you to take notice
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:45231:114"/>of ſuch a one as I, to write to me ſo oft as you have done, but will you indeed bear me upon your warm Heart when you are at the Throne of Grace? I ſeriouſly beg you would, ſurely I am greatly needy, though unworthy of ſuch a Favour, I have been ſmattering at Religion, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed trifling with it for many years, for alaſs the truth is, I make e'en nothing of it to this day; O what a reproach am I to a dear Jeſus, a head ſo full of influences, a root ſo full of ſap, and to his Miniſters and Ordinances I ſit under! Corruptions and Temptations ſtrong and oft prevailing, Grace ordinarily low and languiſhing, nay uſeleſs and unprofitable, poor, and yet upon all occaſions (I ſhould rather ſay, without any thing, that looks like a Colour for it) prone to be Proud! Will you not pity and pray for ſuch an one? Alaſs <hi>Sir,</hi> the Lord knows I have told you true! And when you have lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and opportunity, further refreſh me with a line. But I will not detain you further but conclude here remaining dear</p>

               <p>YOUR'S dated the 6th came ſafe to hand; I have not had any opportunity of ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Books to you, and have been a little thoughtful, becauſe I did not hear from you, ſend with great freedom, and the Lord proſper your pious Deſign.

<pb n="209" facs="tcp:45231:114"/>in diſpoſing of my Lord <hi>Whartons</hi> large Charity) I got him to write to him for ſome help there. His anſwer to my Father was, that as far as his Intereſt would go it ſhould be laid out for us, at their next meeting, which would be ſhortly. I alſo wrote to him my Self, about ten day's or a fortnight ſince to put him in mind of it. I hope we ſhall ſpeed, and as ſoon as I can hear from him Mr. <hi>P.</hi> ſhall know. I wrote to him about three weeks ſince, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by yours, that mine was not come to his Hands. Upon your advice I wrote to them, to put Six poor Children to School, I ſuppoſe thus is, Three at <hi>Elton,</hi> I would have them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue and will pay for them, and when we ſee how we ſpeed at <hi>London,</hi> ſhall know what to do more that way.

<pb n="210" facs="tcp:45231:115"/>at <hi>Elton</hi> together with my own, that you would pleaſe to think of ſettling among them; methinks your private Converſe among them, might be many ways ſetting forward your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters work. I know it will be grievous to you, to think of looſing the frequent advantages you now have of enjoying that holy Man's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, who I queſtion not hath moſt of your ſpare Hours, and poſſibly there may be other Reaſons too, that may be ready to caſt in a vote againſt it, but I need not tell you whoſe Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt muſt give way, when the great God's and our's comes to ſtand in Competition, and that when we ſincerely ſerve him at the moſt ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying rate, he will not yet ſee us looſers by it in the End. And I do alſo with Submiſſion heartily wiſh you would think of ſetting upon a Courſe of Catechiſing and Expounding it; there are divers good things extant that may make your Work eaſy; and in my Thoughts its a thing very needful, and which through the divine bleſſing might be of exceeding Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to them. You might theſe long Day's make room for it, by cutting your Afternoons Sermon a little ſhorter. The Lord direct and encline you that way which ſhall be moſt pleaſing to him, and moſt profitable to precious Souls, and crown your endeavours with abundant Succeſs!

               <p>I Muſt acknowledge, that I am a debter to you of a few Lines, I have not time now to write
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:45231:115"/>many, and alaſs it was well for me if my juſtly grounded fears did not give me cauſe to ſay, that by taking up but a little time in writing, I ſhall thereby occaſion you to throw away the leſs. Its ſad indeed that a borderer upon Eternity (as I have reaſon to look upon my ſelf) ſhould have reaſon to talk at ſuch a rate; but this, though it make it more ſad, it doth not make it leſs true. While I complain of my Self I may not flatter you, but give me leave to ſay this, that both formerly, and when I was laſt with you, I could not but obſerve that in you, which gave me cauſe to think you was got be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me (alaſs! How many could I name; and that ſuch too as have not had my advantages nor any thing near them, whom I once thought at leaſt to have been ſome ſteps behind, who are now put before me!) But I muſt tell you, you have freſh ground enough before you ſtill, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore put on, you will have better company then by laging behind with ſuch as I. I am juſt now thinking what a change there is in the Seaſon of the Year ſince I ſaw you. Then one had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to be thinking of that <hi>[He giveth Snow like Wool, he ſcattereth his Hoar frost like Aſhes: He caſteth forth his Ice like Morſels, who can ſtand before his Cold]</hi> But lo, now the Winter is paſt, the Rain is over and gone; the Flowers ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear on the Earth, the time of the Singing of Birds is come, and the Voice of the Turtle is heard in our Lands. O that I could ſay ſo much of my Soul! But alaſs, though when I look into my Garden, or walk abroad the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure and fragancy of a variety of Objects, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting to entertain my outward Senſes with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, as alſo to raiſe my dull and heavy Heart,

When I examin Matters cloſly, what a poor little is that, which I have to ſhew for my being a Garden more then bare Enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure? But if I ſhould proceed on this melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Subject as I might, I ſhould weary you, or poſſibly tempt you to think I do but counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit Complaints, or that Pride was but work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a more cloſe and cunning way. Indeed who knows the depths of Deceipt, that there are in ſuch Hearts! May my Complaints be an occaſion of your humble chearful Praiſes upon your own Account; may they alſo engage your fervent Prayers on mine. Ariſe O Son of righteouſneſs with healing in thy Wings! A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake O North wind, and come thou South, blow upon our Gardens that the Spices thereof may flow out: Then let our beloved come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Garden, and eat his pleaſant Fruits.

<pb n="214" facs="tcp:45231:117"/>to you about, when I was in <hi>L.</hi> wherein you alſo put me in hopes of ſome Papers in a ſhort time which will be further helpful, for which I return hearty thanks. Since my return from <hi>L.</hi> I have for ſome days been abroad in the Country, and ſince have been confined by bodily Diſtemper, ſo that I have had but little time, but have taken a few ſteps in that Buſineſs, and as ſoon as able ſhall endeavour to proceed according to your direction. My greateſt diſcouragements are in and from my Self, when ever I ſet about any piece of Service, I am ſuch a very ſorry unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Inſtrument, that I am ready to fear that the Lord ſhould utterly reject and throw me by, as one in whom he hath no Pleaſure, though I muſt confeſs he hath ſometimes graciouſly ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized me with the Country, and ſo I would encourage my Self humbly to attempt this alſo, earneſtly begging that you and the Society would help me by your Prayers. Such a Maſter indeed deſerves all the Service that we can ever do him, but ſuch as I (if any ſuch be) are unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the Honour of being employ'd in the meaneſt Part of it. The firſt tidings I had of your pious undertaking was very pleaſing to me, and the more ſo, becauſe of that happy Union of Perſons of different Perſwaſions in your So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties; and truly in my ſmall obſervation of the riſing Generation looking towards Religion, this is one thing which methinks looks not a little comfortably, that they ſeem to be laying aſide much of that narrowneſs of mind, which truly both ſides have generally been too chargeable with, and to be approaching to a more truly Catholick temper, a thing which bodes no ſmall good (I hope) to our Church and Nation. But
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:45231:117"/>herein (which is a ground for a further diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement) you have much the advantage of us in the Country, however if the God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven will but be with us to proſper us, we may thence take Heart to ariſe and build, I thank you for the liberty you give me of holding a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with you about this Affair. I ſhall make bold to trouble you, as no doubt we ſhall have frequent occaſion eſpecially at firſt, and ſhall be glad to hear of your Affairs.

               <p>AS to the Affairs of your Society for Reformation here in this place (bleſſed be God) they go on pretty well, freſh Members are almoſt weekly added to us, and a conſiderable Number of Prophane Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons have been brought to legal Puniſhments, the good Effects of, which do already begin to appear; we are reſolved (the Lord enabling of us) to proſecute this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with utmoſt vigour, and hope in about a Months time to ſet up a publick Lecture on this occaſion, deſigning to have eight Sermons preached to us in the Year, by Conformiſts and Nonconformiſts in their turns, and think to have our Sermons printed, as that may be a means further to ſpread and propagate the thing. And being now (bleſſed be God) pretty well ſettled in our gears here, I look on it as my Duty to uſe my utmoſt endeavours to promote this highly neceſſary good Work elſe where alſo, and among other Places hath for ſome time been in my Eye.
